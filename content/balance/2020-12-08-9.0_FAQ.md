## 9.1 Changes

**{{< spell 274281 "Moons" >}} recharge time reduced from 25 seconds to 20 seconds and 33% dmg buff to NEW and HALF moon:**

Weak buff that makes it good enough for single target but they still scale badly in AoE. This does NOT buff full moon.

**{{< spell 343647 "Solstice" >}} increased Shooting Stars chance reduced from 300% to 250%:**

Major nerf that makes this talent only better on spread AoE instead of being the default pick for everything.

The {{< spell 274281 "Moons" >}} buffs and {{< spell 343647 "Solstice" >}} nerfs will mean that each talent in the row will be used in a different scenario: 
{{< spell 343647 "Solstice" >}} = Spread AoE; {{< spell 211545 "Fury of Elune" >}} = Stacked AoE; {{< spell 274281 "Moons" >}} = Single Target

**{{< spell 202354 "Stellar Drift" >}} reworked to no longer increase duration but damage by 50% instead of 15% and adds a 12 second CD to Starfall:**

For sustained AoE this is no longer a loss but not a gain either. Since there appear to be a number of burst AoE fights in the raid this talent will see use in its current state but for sustained AoE (like higher M+) it will be unlikely taken unless the movement component is of very high value. Independent of how good this talent ends up being giving Starfall a CD leads to very awkward gameplay as we now have even more periods where we are stuck spending Astral Power on Starsurge in AoE when taking this talent in addition to a CD just feeling weird on a main spender ability.

**{{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}} crit chance per stack reduced to 3% but now starts at 8 stacks (24%) reduced over 8 seconds instead of 5:**

Major nerf that was expected to happen and pushes the legi from its throne for most situations. Its only niche is burst damage with Convoke as of now.

**{{< item 180117 "Empyreal Ordnance" >}} now incurs a 40 second trinket cooldown:**

This kills double on use.

All these changes add up to ~5% nerf on single target without double on-use and ~7% with double on-use. The AoE nerf is roughly 4% due to the BoAT and Drift change. Due to loss of movement the loss will be slightly higher in many cases. There will be more changes coming to PTR.

**Covenant specific legendaries:**

**Kyrian:  
{{< spell 354115 "Kindred Affinity" >}}: Give your partner a permanent 150 mastery and you get a permanent 8% stat based on their covenant. This bonus is increased to 10% while the bond is active:**

Kyrian: Mastery (give 150 mastery, receive 200 mastery),
Night Fae: Haste,
Venthyr: Crit,
Necrolord: Versatility

Can be strong when paired with someone who benefits a lot from mastery. Has the potential to make Kyrian viable in a simp meta but does not fix the glaring problems Kyrian has as a whole. Since this was nerfed to only give 150 mastery to your linked partner it will unlikely see play.

**Night Fae:**  
**{{< spell 354118 "Celestial Spirits" >}}: Halves the cooldown of Convoke, reduces the channel time to 3s (to 1min CD and 12 spells cast) and increases the chance of a Full Moon:**

As it stands it gives 16 Niya mastery stacks and uses a deck of cards system which makes Convoke always cast 1 Full Moon in 2 Convoke casts. It also slightly more than halves the Starsurges and Wrath casts. With current tuning it is very weak and won't see play.

**Necrolord:  
{{< spell 354123 "Unbridled Swarm" >}}: Adaptive Swarm has a 60% chance to split into 2 Swarms when it expires on a target:**

Useless on single target but possibly good for 2-4 targets as it allows for much higher uptime. Increases the offensive swarms you get per cast from 2 to 3.56 which equates to a 78% increase. Still does not make Necrolord competitive.

**Venthyr:  
{{< spell 354109 "Sinful Hysteria" >}}: Every time you cast a spell during Ravenous Frenzy its duration is increased by 0.2 seconds. Additional extends the buff another 5s after it expires without being able to stack further:**

This legendary roughly adds 8+5 seconds during Bloodlust or 6+5 seconds without Bloodlust to the Frenzy effect. Allows for extremely high burst every 3min over the ~35 seconds, ~~probably~~ beating anything else in the game for "bursts" of that duration. Is currently by far the best legendary we have.

## [Openers](#openers)

</div>

Venthyr - with {{< spell 202430 "Nature's Balance(NB)" >}}:<br/> {{< spell 190984 "Wrath" >}}, Wrath, {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}}(combat starts half-way through the cast), dots, with NO Bloodlust: Starfire until 90+ AsP, {{< spell 102560 "Incarnation" >}}, {{< spell 323546 "Ravenous Frenzy" >}}, Wrath until max AsP if not there already, {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" >}} 1x

Start casting from max range at ~3.5-4.5 sec.


<div id="aoe">
 
## [What is my AoE priority?](#aoe)

</div>

**Venthyr specific notes will be marked with (V) at the start of a point and Night Fae specific ones will be marked with (NF)**

**AoE starting at 2 targets:**

**Any situation:**

- Keep up {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" >}} as long as your targets will live for another ~10 seconds (the amount of time is reduced per target hit).

- Keep up {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" >}} at all times or use on cooldown with{{< spell 202354 "Stellar Drift" >}} .

**Outside any Eclipse:**

- Refresh {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}} outside of Eclipse if and only if ALL of the following are true:
    - The next eclipse you will enter is Lunar Eclipse
    - All targets can be hit by {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}}
    - There are 5 or less targets (10 or less with {{< spell 281847 "Twin Moons" >}}).
    - All targets will live through the entire Lunar Eclipse
    - You will not lose {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" >}} uptime.

- Enter the next Eclipse if in no Eclipse, preferring Lunar Eclipse.

**Lunar Eclipse and both Eclipses (CA/Inc):**

- Use {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" >}} to stop yourself from overcapping AsP until 6 targets at which point you should overcap.

- Refresh {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}} if you are at 4 (8 with {{< spell 281847 "Twin Moons" >}}) targets or below if the targets will live through the next Eclipse.

- Cast {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}}.

**Solar Eclipse:**

- Use Starsurge to stop yourself from overcapping AsP.

- Keep up {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}} on up to 10 targets (20 with {{< spell 281847 "Twin Moons" >}}) if they will live through the next Eclipse and you won't lose {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" >}} uptime.

- Starfire when 5 targets can be hit by it, increased by 1 target for every 20% mastery you have.

- Cast {{< spell 190984 "Wrath" >}}.

**BEFORE cooldowns:**

- If the pack will last more than 35s put {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}} on up to 8 targets (16 with {{< spell 281847 "Twin Moons" >}}). This happens very rarely but is a gain in case it happens.
- (V) Refresh {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" >}} so you only have to refresh it once during Cooldowns.

**(V) DURING {{< spell 323546 "Ravenous Frenzy" >}}:**
- Refresh {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" >}} during pandemic.
- Keep {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" >}} up at all times or on cooldown with {{< spell 202354 "Stellar Drift" >}}. Try to time the last {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" >}} with Drift so that it will be up during the last 8s of your cooldowns.
- Refresh {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}} on up to 6 (12 with {{< spell 281847 "Twin Moons" >}}) targets when they will live for another ~20 seconds.
- https://wago.io/mYVIsyQN8 for filler. The recommendation this WeakAura gives is not correct when your targets will die before your cooldowns end or the targets are spread.
- If the filler is {{< spell 190984 "Wrath" >}} or up to 5 targets use {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" >}} to prevent overcapping.

**Notes:**

- This should be used as a priority, going from top to bottom.


<div id="st">

## [What is my Single Target rotation?](#st)

</div>

The venthyr only version can be found [here](/balance/2021-06-05-Venthyr-Compendium/#single-target).

**Venthyr specific notes will be marked with (V) at the start of a point and Night Fae specific ones will be marked with (NF)**


**Single target priority list OUTSIDE cooldowns:** 
- Keep up {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}}, {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" >}} and {{< spell 202347 "Stellar Flare" >}} and refresh within pandemic
- Enter the next Eclipse, preferring Solar Eclipse
- Cast {{< spell 211545 "Fury of Elune" >}} if it will be up again for your next usage in CA/Inc
- (NF) Cast {{< spell 274281 "Moons" >}} if you are in Lunar Eclipse or you are overcapping charges inside solar eclipse. If possible save charges for CA/INC.
- Cast {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" >}} when you would overcap Astral Power before entering the next Eclipse. This usually equates to spending 3 Starsurges at the start like you did with BoAT but can vary. Don't spend if you need to move soon.
- Cast {{< spell 190984 "Wrath" >}} in Solar Eclipse
- Cast {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}} in Lunar Eclipse
- Cast dots if have nothing to cast while you are moving

**(V) Single target priority list BEFORE cooldowns:**
- Make sure to have 90+ Astral Power before using cooldowns. The only exception is when Bloodlust would run out before Inc expires at which point you Inc+Frenzy sooner. This happens with Bloodlust on pull.
- Make sure {{< spell 211545 "Fury of Elune" >}} will be up in the last 4 sec of your {{< spell 323546 "Ravenous Frenzy" >}}.

**(V) Single target priority list INSIDE cooldowns:**
Before the 5s extension buff:
- Use your trinket so that it will be for the rest of your cooldowns. (For example at 13s remaining for IQD or 17s in Bloodlust)
- Use pot at 17s {{< spell 323546 "Ravenous Frenzy" >}} remaining
- Cast {{< spell 211545 "Fury of Elune" >}} if {{< spell 323546 "Ravenous Frenzy" >}} has 4 or less seconds remaining
- Cast {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" >}} to prevent capping Astral Power
- Keep up {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}}, {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" >}} and {{< spell 202347 "Stellar Flare" >}}
- Cast {{< spell 190984 "Wrath" >}} to fill

**(V) During the 5s Ravenous Frenzy extension buff:**
- Cast {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" >}} to spend all your Astral Power
- Cast {{< spell 190984 "Wrath" >}} to fill

**(NF)Convoke the Spirits and Pulsar usage:**
- Cast Convoke inside any {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}} / {{< spell 102560 "INC" >}} window (also meaing pulsar windows).
- If possible try lining up a pooled up Pulsar with {{< spell 102560 "INC" >}}. It is important to note that if you are already in Inc, proccing pulsar will extend the duration of Inc, but using Inc inside a pulsar window will not extend it.

**Notes:** 
- Due to no longer using Balance of All Things there is no longer as compelling of a reason to {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" >}}at the beginning of an Eclipse and thus you can often save Astral Power for movement without any relevant dps loss. {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" >}}Empowerment exists but it is a very weak effect.

- (V) With {{< spell 202354 "Stellar Drift" >}} AND {{< spell 114107 "Soul of the Forest" >}} it is only a 1% dps loss to use Starfall on CD including during Frenzy so if there is any movement at all use Starfall when you happen to be attacking a single target with it talented. With {{< spell 102560 "Incarnation" >}} talented you should avoid using Starfalls during Frenzy as it is a much bigger loss but with {{< spell 202354 "Stellar Drift" >}} Starfall should still be used to avoid downtime. Do not just use {{< spell 202354 "Stellar Drift" >}} for a pure single target fight as it is still a ~4% dps loss doing this compared to {{< spell 202347 "Stellar Flare " >}} unless there is no way of getting a good Frenzy window without it.


<div id="filler">
 
## [What is my filler priority inside CA?](#filler)

</div>

1 Target:
- Starfire if at or above 110% haste for Night Fae and 150% for Venthyr (You would currently need both Bloodlust and Power Infusion or other external haste buffs in order to reach this amount. A WeakAura tracking your current haste value might come in handy.)
- {{< spell 190984 "Wrath" >}} if below 110% haste for Night Fae and 150% for Venthyr

2 Targets and above:
- {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}}


<div id="owlkin-frenzy">

## [How do I use instant Starfire procs from Owlkin Frenzy?](#owlkin-frenzy)

</div>

When Lunar Eclipse is active use {{< spell 157228 "Owlkin Frenzy" >}} procs asap. When ONLY Solar Eclipse is active use it when fighting 3+ targets or when you need to move. Otherwise let it expire.


<div id="snapshot">

## [Do our dots snapshot?](#snapshot)

</div>

No, our dots ({{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}}, {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" >}}, {{< spell 202347 "Stellar Flare " >}}) do NOT snapshot, everything is dynamic. That means any dots gain/lose the mastery bonus upon entering/leaving the Eclipse that buffs them.

<div id="stats">
 
## [What is Balance Druids stat priority?](#stats)

</div>

Sim yourself using [Raidbots Top Gear](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear). Do not follow any stat priorities.


<div id="trinkets">

## [What Trinkets should I use?](#trinkets)

</div>

**DISCLAIMER: All of the trinkets in the following are examples. Your personal best trinkets depend on more factors such as ilvl meaning the best option is always to sim using either Top Gear, Droptimizer or Gear Compare.**

**There are 3 setups for trinket combinations:**
1. Double on-use
2. One on-use + one equip
3. Double equip


**Double on-use:**
This combination can prove to be the strongest from all the other trinket combinations IF you are playing **Venthyr with the {{< item 355315 "Sinful Hysteria" >}} legendary**. The only problem is that it requires specific trinkets and may prove hard to use. You want to line up the last 5 sec from the bloodlusted IQD buff AND Bell with the first 3 starsurges inside the Hysteria window. (5 sec after using Ravenous Frenzy)


Usable Trinkets:
- Slot 1: {{< item 179350 "Inscrutable Quantum Device" >}}
- Slot 2: {{< item 184842 "Instructor's Divine Bell" >}}


**2. One on-use, one equip:**
This combination should be used whenever double on-use is not a viable choice. A good example would be in M+ where without a lot of practice and coordination the pulling and damage pattern can be very volatile and you might have to use your cooldowns instantly.

Usable trinkets:
- Slot 1 (Equip): {{< item 186421 "Forbidden Necromantic Tome" >}}, {{< item 178708 "Unbound Changeling" >}}, {{< item 178386 "Insignia of Alacrity" >}} and others.
- Slot 2 (On-use): {{< item 179350 "Inscrutable Quantum Device" >}}, {{< item 184842 "Instructor's Divine Bell" >}}, {{< item 180117 "Empyreal Ordnance" >}} and others. 


**3. Double Equip:**
This combination is basically a budget version of the previous one, as in most scenarios the one of on-use trinket is going to outshine the 2nd on-use trinket due to the bursty damage pattern inside our {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}} paired with {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}}

Usable trinkets:
- Slot 1+2 (Equip): {{< item 186421 "Forbidden Necromantic Tome" >}}, {{< item 178708 "Unbound Changeling" >}}, {{< item 178386 "Insignia of Alacrity" >}} and others.

**Notable trinkets:**
{{< item 179350 "Inscrutable Quantum Device" >}}: This trinket has the potential to be the best on-use trinket by a large margin if the conditions found in [#11](#iqd) are met. These ultimately mean that the trinket is extremely good in M+ and whenever you can gurantee that later trinket usages are either in Bloodlust or when healers still have enough mana. You can adjust the value in sims using the IQD Stat Proc Chance option which will set the chance the trinket gives stats outside Bloodlust.

{{< item 184842 "Instructor's Divine Bell" >}}: Unlike the Quantum Device, the bell is a very consistent trinket that gives us a lot of mastery inside our burst windows. The only downside of this trinket is its aquisiton, a very low drop chance from bastion callings, mission table rewards or a worldquest.

{{< item 180117 "Empyreal Ordnance" >}}: A pretty unique trinket that is split into two parts: a dot and a buff. After the dot finishes, the buff part of the trinket comes back to the caster. Due to this trinket putting other on use trinkets on a 40 sec cd, it should only be used with an equip trinket. If IQD is not usable or the ilvl discrepancy between these two trinkets is too big, then this trinket might be the best choice as Venthyr.

{{< item 186421 "Forbidden Necromantic Tome" >}}: An overall solid trinket that can be obtained at higher ilvl than other trinkets.

{{< item 186423 "Titanic Ocular Gland" >}}: A very good trinket if you are able above 50% health most of the encounter.

{{< item 178708 "Unbound Changeling" >}}: This trinket gains most of its value from the fact that it is convertable into a stat proc of your choice by eating the corresponding food. Once a day it has a chance to proc 3 secondary stats which further increases its value. Mastery proc can be used a default but sim to find which secondary it should proc.

{{< item 178386 "Insignia of Alacrity" >}}: Another equip trinket which has both positives and negatives. The negatives being that the trinket has a low stat budget and the positives being that it can be easily acquired through PvP at 226 ilvl if you can reach 2.1k rating.

{{< item 178809 "Soulletting Ruby" >}}: Although this trinket gives crit it gives a very high amount of it making it a very good option if you don't have access to another on-use trinket. When using it mind that it has a short delay before getting the buff depending on distance to the target.


<div id="talents">
 
## [What Talents should I run?](#talents)

</div>

**Default single target setup (pure single target raid bosses) pick Starlord only with BoAT:**
{{< talents spec="balance" src="live" recommend="322,113,223,333,133,113,233" >}}
{{< spell 211545 "Fury of Elune" >}} and {{< spell 102560 "Incarnation" >}} should be used as Venthyr.

**Default AoE setup (M+ and heavy AoE bosses):**
{{< talents spec="balance" src="live" recommend="322,113,223,333,311,331,231" >}}
Note that {{< spell 248280 "Force of Nature" >}} can and should be used in M+ for any key level where the tank could die even though they are a minor dps loss.
WoE currently sims higher on 4+ sustained target counts and it might see some play on fights like Kel'Thuzad.
The choice between TM and Drift depends on how long targets live and how much value the movement has.

**Mixed target count or mostly spread AoE (Inerva, Council):**
{{< talents spec="balance" src="live" recommend="321,113,223,333,232,331,231" >}}
{{< spell 102560 "Incarnation" >}} should only be used for spread AoE or for 2target cleave situations paired with SD.


<div id="t50">
 
## [T50 row choices and playstyle (9.1)](#t50)

<div>
 

**In 9.1 we will probably have at least two playable builds depending on the covenant:**

   - NF Pulsar 
   - Venthyr Hysteria

**Venthyr Hysteria:**

- {{< spell 343647 "Solstice" >}} is playable in spread aoe but requires 3+ targets of permanent uptime which can be very very hard to find. The closest example where Solstice would beat FoE on paper would be Council of Blood from Castle Nathria.

- {{< spell 202770 "FoE" >}} is incredibly strong with this build beating out any other talent in 99% of the situations on both ST and stacked AoE. You will want to use FoE whenever you have 4 sec left on Ravenous Frenzy inside Incarnation, and on cd inside any eclipse whenever outside of it.

- {{< spell 274281 "Moons" >}} should never get picked with this build as they are inferior to FoE in every scenario.

**Night Fae Pulsar:**

- {{< spell 343647 "Solstice" >}} is a better choice for this build when compared to Venthyr because of the fact that FoE is not as strong, meaning that you will have more oportunities to pick this talent depending on the raid fight.

- {{< spell 202770 "FoE" >}} is again very strong, but this time only on stacked AOE rather than ST and should be used when you enter CA or on cd as the first global of a new eclipse if CA+Convoke are not available. 

- {{< spell 274281 "Moons" >}} should be picked over FoE as they are the roughly a 0.7% dps upgrade over FoE on pure ST. Save moons for CA/Inc without overcapping and if not inside CA/Inc they should preferably be casted inside Lunar Eclipse.


<div id="conduits">
 
## [What Conduits should I pick?](#conduits)

</div>

**Potency:**
- {{< spell 341383 "Endless Thrist" >}}:100% of the time this should be your first go to potency slot as Venthyr.
- {{< spell 341446 "Conflux of the Elements" >}}: 100% of the time this should be your first go to potency slot as Night Fae.
- {{< spell 340708 "Fury of the Skies" >}}: Default go to as a secondary slot.
- {{< spell 340706 "Precise Alignment" >}}: For Venthyr this is an exceptionally good conduit because of the Sinful Hysteria legendary and should always be used in tandem with it. For Night Fae around the same value as Fury and Umbral, you can pick it if you don't know which of the other two to pick, might have some value if you want to extend your burst windows on AoE.
- {{< spell 340719 "Umbral Intensity" >}}: Situational usage, but gets outshone by Fury and Precise.
- {{< spell 340720 "Stellar Inspiration" >}}: Currently not ever worth using with only two Potency slots available.

Notes: 
Night Fae: Conflux is always used and the only choice to be made is between your 2nd potency slot which should be Fury or Umbral most of the time. This is mostly dungeon/personal preference as they have around the same throughput.
Venthyr: Endless Thirst should always be used and Precise should be used if you have the Sinful Hysteria legendary equipped.

**Endurance:**
- {{< spell 340553 "Well-Honed Instincts" >}}: Default go to, one of the most overtuned endurance conduits in the game raid wise.
- {{< spell 340540 "Ursine Vigor" >}}: Really good if you will ever go into bear form to soak an ability. Especially good on progression and if you will ever press Heart of the Wild while being talented into Guardian Affinity. Examples: SLG Goliath wicked blade overlap / Sludgefist 2nd Chain Slam.
- {{< spell 340529 "Tough as Bark" >}}: Good if you press Barkskin a lot or the fight timers require a shorter CD on it.
- {{< spell 340543 "Innate Resolve" >}}: You can think of this as a buff to Well-Honed Instincts.
- {{< spell 340605 "Layered Mane" >}}: Unlike Well-hones Instincs this is a Guardian conduit that actually only Guardian wants.

Notes: Default Instincts and pick one of the other three usable conduits as your second choice.

**Finesse:**
- {{< spell 341450 "Front of the Pack" >}}: The best default pick as roar is very useful on many raid encounters and to get around dungeons quicker.
- {{< spell 341280 "Born Anew" >}}: Useful pick to get someone up again without them losing as much damage from the lost food buff. Can no longer be used before a pull as the food buff will reset to 20 main stat on raid combat start.
- {{< spell 341451 "Born of the Wilds" >}}: Good in M+ if you have to offheal a lot.
- {{< spell 340545 "Tireless Pursuit" >}}: Might help a bit if you find yourself using cat/travel form a lot to fill movement gaps.


<div id="soulbinds">
 
## [What Soulbinds should I pick?](#soulbinds)

</div>

**Night Fae:**
- 99% of the time [Niya](https://ptr.wowhead.com/soulbind-calc/night-fae/niya/druid) - Use {{< spell 320659 "Burrs" >}} for 1-3 targets and when there aren't any immune targets it can proc on. Otherwise use a second/third potency conduit.

## [What Legendaries should I craft?](#legendaries)

</div>

**Night Fae:**

In Raid: {{< spell 338668 "Pulsar" >}}

In M+: {{< spell 338668 "Pulsar" >}} is likely the better option as of now.

**Venthyr:**

In Raid: {{< item 355315 "Sinful Hysteria" >}}

In M+: {{< item 355315 "Sinful Hysteria" >}} whenever you can use it to its full potential and {{< spell 338657 "Circle" >}} or {{< spell 338668 "Pulsar" >}} otherwise.

Note: Until Sinful Hysteria becomes available you can use Circle/Pulsar for AoE and Dreambinder for ST

<div id="legendaries-slot">

## [What slot do I craft legendaries in?](#legendaries-slot)

</div>

**{{< spell 354109 "Sinful Hysteria" >}} slot:**

Craft this on Belt because of the Domination Sockets.

**{{< spell 338668 "Pulsar" >}} slot:**

Craft this on Ring because of the Domination Sockets.

**{{< spell 338657 "Circle" >}} slot:**

Ring because of the Domination Sockets.

**{{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}} slot:**

You should craft the legendary on Legs because of the Domination Sockets.

<div id="covenant">

## [What Covenant should I pick?](#covenant)

</div>

**Night Fae:**

By far the easiest covenant to play and has very competitive Single Target dps with basically no drawback other than it not scaling into AOE almost at all.

**Kyrian:**

Can perform well with a partner and is better in AoE than Night Fae but due to how the ability works it's rare to be able to get good value.

**Venthyr:**

Currently with the new legendary {{< item 355315 "Sinful Hysteria" >}} it outsims Night Fae in both Single target and AOE, but due to its higher skill requirement, the fact that you HAVE to stand still and cast for the duration of your cooldowns (around 30 sec) and your damage is backloaded inside your cooldowns (mobs have to live for the duration of your cooldowns) it might lose to Night fae in practice.

**Necrolord:**

Not currently competitive.

  
  
<div id="domination-sockets">

## [What Domination Sockets should I use?](#domination-sockets)

</div>

With the current iteration of Domination Sockets you should use the Chaos Bane set. After you get the set which includes the Dyz gem, you should look to get the Bek and Cor gems which are both situationally extremely strong. In add fights prefer the Cor gem and in single target fights prefer the Bek gem if you have to choose.

**Should I delay Convoke for it to line up with CA?**


Yes you should always delay {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}} UNLESS you can cast a Convoke without losing a {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}}+Convoke (both at the same time) cast. This will for example happen in 5 minute fights where you would cast Convoke+CA on pull, Convoke alone after 2 minutes and then Convoke+CA at 4 minutes.

For M+ the same logic applies when you for example know you won't be using your CA for another 2min due to saving it for a boss you can use a solo Convoke. This should be minimized though as every desynced Convoke is a damage loss.

If you are playing with the Primordial Arcanic Pulsar legendary you should use {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}} whenever you are in either a Pulsar or a {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}} / {{< spell 102560 "INC" >}} window.
  
**What is the chance of getting Full Moon during Convoke?**
  
The chance of getting a Full Moon during Convoke the Spirits is based on a "Stacked Deck" system with a deck of 5 cards. What this means every time we enter a new combat we get a deck of 5 cards and one of them is Full Moon. Every time we use Convoke one card is drawn so the first cast always has a 20% chance of casting Full Moon. If the first cast didn't proc a Full Moon the second cast will have a 1/4=25% chance to proc one and so on. After the whole deck has been drawn or you leave combat a new deck of 5 cards is created. In a normal raid encounter this mechanic means that you will never get more than 1 Full Moon unless you died as you'd have to cast 6 Convokes to even have a chance to get another Full Moon.

**How does the covenant legendary affect Convoke?**

Currently it halves the amount of spells cast and casts 1.6 Wraths, 1.5 Starsurges, 0.9 Starfalls and 0.5 Full Moons on average when every target is dotted. This is less than half the balance specs you would get without the Legi. Addtionally the legendary reduces the amount of cards in the deck for Full Moon from 5 to 2.

The following are super minor things you can do but are ultimately very insignificant:
- Dotting outside Eclipse without losing dot uptime on single target is a ~0.4% gain when not using Solstice.
- At 150%+ haste using {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}} is minorly better than{{< spell 190984 "Wrath" >}} on single target. This will only happen with Power Infusion or very high haste.
- With {{< spell 202354 "Stellar Drift" >}} it is only a very minor loss (1-2%) to {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" >}} during {{< spell 323546 "Ravenous Frenzy" >}} as long as you enter Sinful Hysteria with 90+ AsP.
- Without Incarnation and a low enough {{< spell 340706 "Precise Alignment" >}} it is a minor gain to use {{< spell 323546 "Ravenous Frenzy" >}}  before Celestial Alignment so that CA will be up throughout Frenzy+Hysteria. The exact timing depends on your {{< spell 340706 "Precise Alignment" >}} rank but it should be no more than 2 globals after the Frenzy cast.
- If the fight time allows it wait for Euphoria/Fatal Flaw(Nadija Soulbinds) before using cooldowns. This is relevant for 5-6 min kill times.
- If the fight allows it wait for pot to be up again. This is relevant for 6min fights.

<div id="gear">

# [Gear:](#gear)

**Simming:**

Once everything is on live you will be able to sim as normal and that will, as always, give you the best results. It is to note that for Venthyr sims adjusting the fight duration can have a relevant impact on how strong some items maybe so it can be beneficial to adjust the sim duration to fight the fight you are simming for. Keep in mind that there will be a 20% fight length variance in sims meaning that a 5min sim is actually a 4-6min sim.

**Trinkets:**

Generally you will want an on-use trinket and the strongest passive trinket you can find. The strongest on-use trinkets are {{< item 179350 "Inscrutable Quantum Device" >}}, {{< item 180117 "Empyreal Ordnance" >}} (yes, without double on-use) and {{< item 184842 "Instructor's Divine Bell" >}} (yes, it's still broken even at low ilvl). IQD and Bell can be combined for a minor dps increase in the sub 0.5% area, although if that is better with your ilvl trinket you will have to sim. The raid on-use trinkets are all bad because we are a 3min class.

As a passive trinket you have a plethora of options. For single target your best options are the new trinkets {{< item 186423 "Titanic Ocular Gland" >}} (2nd boss raid), {{< item 186421 "Forbidden Necromantic Tome" >}} (last boss raid), {{< item 186422 "Tome of Monstrous Constructions" >}} (1st boss raid), {{< item 178769 "Infinitely Divisble Ooze" >}}, {{< item 178708 "Unbound Changeling" >}}, {{< item 187447 "Soul Cage Fragment" >}} (World Boss) and a bunch of others. For AoE/M+ the damage proc trinkets fall off meaning you won't want the Tome or Oooze but the other trinkets stay as good. As always just sim what trinkets are best from the ones you have.

**Ideal stats:**

Ideal stats are something that are not realistic to achieve and should thus not be a goal of any kind, this section is purely for interest. Independent of that with Venthyr Balance Druid mastery and haste are far, far more valuable than crit and vers as your sims will show. In fact when you could choose any kind of stats you wouldn't want any crit or vers but again this is not realistic.

- How does Kindred Spirits (Kyrian covenant ability) work?

When you use {{< spell 326434 "Kindred Spirits" >}} both people get an empty pool that lasts 20 seconds and 15% of your damage, healing and damage taken empties the pool to increase/absorb each. Each person also gets a buff that lasts 10 seconds and during that time 20% of your damage fills up the pool of the other person.



- Who do I bond Kindred Spirits with and when do I use it?


All specs with a 1min cd on abilities are good, for example Mages and MM hunter. Always make sure you use it when your partner uses his cd and when using {{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}} make sure a {{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}} window is within the Empower Bond buff.

## [Useful CA + Convoke + Trinket macro:](#swifty-macro)

</div>


```
#showtooltip
/stopmacro [channeling: convoke the spirits]
/stopmacro [noform:4]
/cast Celestial Alignment
/cleartarget
/use 13
/targetlasttarget
/use Potion of Spectral Intellect
/cast Convoke the Spirits
/cqs
```

**Explanation:**

- This is for Night Fae only!
- DO NOT use this macro while on the gcd (like just having casted a dot or Starsurge) or the {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}} will not fire. Wait until the gcd is finished.

- "#showtooltip" makes the tooltip of {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}} show upon hovering over the macro.
- "/stopmacro [channeling: convoke the spirits]" prevents the macro from being casted if you are currently channeling {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}}.
- "/stopmacro [noform:4]" prevents the macro from being casted if you are NOT in Moonkin Form.
- "/cast Celestial Alignment" casts {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}}.
- "/cleartarget" clears your current target. This is useful whenever using the "Inscrutable Quantum Device" trinket and makes it so that the trinket does not use its execute part. Do not use this with a targeted trinket.
- "/use 13" uses the trinket in the 13/upper slot. You can use 14 if your on-use trinket is in the bottom slot.
- "/targetlasttarget retargets your last target after being cleared by the "cleartarget". 
- "/use Potion of Spectral Intellect" uses your potion. If your potion is not assigned to any specific point you can put it here.
- "/cast Convoke the Spirits" uses the Nightfae covenant ability.
- "/cqs" cancels your queued spell. Convoke can sometimes cancel itself when using a macro due to weirdness with spell queuing. This stops any weirdness thus your Convoke from ever cancelling itself.

You can and should remove/add other commands to this macro depending on situation. For example the potion line, or the "stopmacro [noform:4]" line.


<div id="iqd">
 
## [How does Inscrutable Quantum Device work?](#iqd)

</div>

When this trinket is used, it triggers the effect with the first condition that applies from the following list:

- Remove CC from self: Always triggers if you are under a hard CC mechanic, does not trigger if the CC mechanic does not prevent the player from acting (e.g., it won't trigger while rooted).

- Heal spell: Triggers on self or a nearby target with less than 30% health remaining.

- Execute damage: Deals damage to the target if it is an enemy with less than 20% health remaining. (You can prevent this by untargetting the mob via a macro, see [#19](#swifty-macro).)

- If a Bloodlust buff is up, the stat buff will last 25 seconds instead of the default 20 seconds, always be your highest rating and have higher prio than giving mana.

- Triggers on a nearby healer with less than 30% mana.

- The secondary stat granted is randomly selected from the player's two highest secondary stats in terms of rating.


<div id="astral-damage">
 
## [What is Astral damage?](#astral-damage)

</div>

Astral damage is Arcane and Nature damage at the same time meaning that these spells benefit from effects that buff either spell school and double dip whenever effects that buff both are active. Mind that class buffs only affect class spells so if a trinket does nature or arcane damage they are not affected by our buffs to these spell classes.
