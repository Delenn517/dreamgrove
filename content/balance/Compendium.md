## 10.1 Updates

### Summary of the changes

10.1 is on the PTR and we are once again receiving major changes and a new tier set. You can read the Blizzard post on the changes here: https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/feedback-druids-in-embers-of-neltharion/1541376 Additionally our tier set is the following: 
>(2) Set Bonus: Sunfire radius increased by 3 yds. Sunfire, Moonfire and Shooting Stars damage increased by 20%.

Looking to be a 4-5.5% dps increase in most situations and adds some QoL through the increased Sunfire radius.

>(4) Set Bonus: Shooting Stars has a 20% chance to instead call down a Crashing Star, dealing (76.5% of Spell power) Astral damage to the target and generating 5 Astral Power.

Adds 60% Shooting Stars damage and 30% Astral Power on average. This roughly makes us have the same AP gen from ShS as we have currently since we lose Stellar Flare Shooting Stars. Also looks to be a 4-5% dps incrase.

The changes result in a large single target buff of about 10% compared to live, including the changes to our current tier set. How it affects our AoE damage is TBD.

### Analyzing the changes

>Shooting Stars can no longer be triggered by Stellar Flare.

Heavy nerf to Stellar Flare which results in it becoming a dead talent with the new talent Wild Surges and Astral Smolder. Even if tuned back up again, Stellar Flare would only see play in single target or spread cleave encounters.

>New Talent: Wild Surges. Your chance to critically strike with Wrath and Starfire is increased by 15% and they generate 2 additional Astral Power. This is a choice node with Stellar Flare.

This talent has a lot of synergy with other talents, namely Astral Smolder and Soul of the Forest. The crit on fillers directly synergizes with Astral Smolder and the resulting Waning Twilight uptime. Soul of the Forest multiplies the 2 extra Astral Power generated by this talent.

>Wrath and Starfire generate 10 Astral Power (up from 8). Moonfire and Sunfire generate 6 Astral Power (up from 2). Stellar Flare generates 10 Astral Power (up from 8)

All of these are mostly to make up for losing the free spender casts from our current 4pc. Moonfire+Sunfire generating more Astral Power is a very welcome change so we have something to press during movement that isn't fully useless.

>Nature’s Balance generates 2 Astral Power every 3 seconds (up from 1 every 2)

A buff is a buff but this talent was already only picked for pure single target and is still unpickable anytime you want do AoE damage since it requires you to skip either Twin Moons or Aetherial Kindling.

>Starsurge and Starfall damage increased by 20%.

Another buff to make up for losing our current 4pc.

>Astral Smolder deals damage over 8 seconds (up from 4) and its damage is increased to 40/80% of spell damage done (up from 20/40%).

As mentioned previously this synergizes with Wild Surges and more or less fully replaces both Stellar Flare and Fungal Growth as our ways of keeping up Waning Twilight. With current tuning a must-pick in every situation.

>Cosmic Rapidity increases the rate at which Moonfire, Sunfire, and Stellar Flare deal damage by 20% (down from 25%).

A minor nerf that doesn't really change anything. Will still be must-pick. 

>Touch the Cosmos, the 10.0 (4) Set Armor bonus, now reduces the Astral Power cost of your first Starsurge or Starfall after entering Eclipse by 5 and increases its damage by 20% (was free and 35% increased damage).

Expected nerf since we would be wearing the set until the end of times otherwise. This makes it roughly be a 2% dps boost so it will easily be replaced by our new tier set.

>Soul of the Forest now increases Starfire’s damage and AP generation during Eclipse by 30% for each target hit beyond the first, up to 90%. (Was 150% bonus to Starfire’s AOE damage)

This more than halves the damage Starfire does currently which indirectly nerfs all talents that buff Starfire's damage(Astral Smolder, Umbral Intensity and Umbral Embrace). To make up for that, Starfire no longer generate depressing amounts of AP in AoE and will have us need to cast just 2 Starfires on average until we can cast another Starfall.

>Power of Goldrinn damage increased by 75%.
>Denizen of the Dream: Faerie Dragon damage increased by 20%.

Both of these are welcome single target buffs which is what Balance Druid is by far the worst at currently. Both of these talents will be required to do relevant single target damage.

>Friend of the Fae now increases Arcane and Nature damage by 8% for 20 seconds (was 4% for 30 seconds).

This capstone was never used again after the last changes but since it becomes a ~5% dps boost with this buff, it will see play in nearly every situation. It also has to be noted that with 10.0.7 Denizen of the Dream is getting a 100% proc rate increase which is included in the calculation.

>Elune’s Guidance now reduces the cost of Starsurge by 8 and Starfall by 10 during Incarnation: Chosen of Elune (was reduces the cost of Starsurge by 5 and Starfall by 8).

Relatively minor buff compared to the other capstones so this will unlikely see play. Comes out at a 3-5% dps increase depending on situation and talent setup.
>Radiant Moonlight also increases Fury of Elune’s damage by 50% and now reduces its cooldown by 20 seconds (was 15 seconds).
>Radiant Moonlight increases the damage dealt by New Moon, Half Moon, and Full Moon by 25%.

While it may look tame on the surface, the real power of this talent is that it always grants both benefits independent of what talent you picked. This means that it buffs all Orbit Breaker Full Moons and Sundered Firmament Fury of Elunes even when having picked the other talent beforehand. Moons have been indirectly nerfed by the buff to our generators and Radiant Moonlight isn't helping by giving a much larger benefit to Fury of Elune so Fury of Elune is locked for every situation including single target. Radiant Moonlight is currently about a 7% dps increase on single target and 6% in AoE so it will be must pick in more or less every situation.

### New builds

As discussed in the previous section we now have a lot of talents that were previously ignored and are now strong enough to be picked in all situations. Due to this we are currently looking to be using the same spec tree for most situations which looks like this:
[AoE Talents](https://mimiron.raidbots.com/simbot/render/talents/BYGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFASSEBEJkkEJRKCtEHIJJRJJkcgQolUiQEFAKAA?bgcolor=000000)

A 2 target build would look something like this:
[2T Talents](https://mimiron.raidbots.com/simbot/render/talents/BYGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFASSEBEJkkEJRKCtEHIJJRJJkkAaJlIRQBgCAA?bgcolor=000000)

When we don't need Starfall we can talent it away to gain Nature's Balance and Warrior of Elune which is slightly outperforming Treants:
[ST Talents](https://mimiron.raidbots.com/simbot/render/talents/BYGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFASSEBEJkkEJRKCtEHIRSUS0kcgQolUSCR0AoAAA?bgcolor=000000)

Wild Mushrooms+Fungal Growth are hard to argue for since you have to give up a very large amount of sustained damage for the burst they give. Nonetheless if all an encounter requires is AoE burst damage, they still exist and would be used but the chances of that happening are low.

Rattle the Stars is getting an indirect buff because our spender casts are now more spread out than before which naturally benefits Rattle uptime. Starweaver is still stronger on 2 targets and whenever you want to do efficient priority damage.

A side of effect of no longer using Stellar Flare, Wild Mushrooms and the less of the current 4pc means that the spec becomes far easier to play for better or worse. AoE is simply putting up dots and then spamming Starfire until you can press Starfall.

Umbral Embrace is simply not strong enough compared to another point in Astral Smolder but the dps difference between those picks is more or less irrelevant. Another result of this is that Sundered Firmament has fallen out of favor since you would need to waste another point in the middle tree and it's not longer better than our capstones. 
Umbral Intensity is a dead talent with the Starfire damage nerfs and Lunar Shrapnel, Astral Communion, Light of the Sun and Stellar Innervation stay dead.

### Will we go into Solar Eclipse on single target?
Yes, with Soul of the Forest talented, which will always be the case, going into Solar Eclipse is a 1% dps gain again. Without Soul of the Forest it would still be a 1% dps loss.

[6T](https://mimiron.raidbots.com/simbot/report/84ZUu1fFfoDqAKzRDfkchp)\
For now it's looking like we are to craft [Slimy Expulsion Boots](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193451/slimy-expulsion-boots) and [Toxified](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr/item=193552/toxified-armor-patch) embellishment added to a crafted leather piece.\
[Slimy Expulsion Boots](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193451/slimy-expulsion-boots) performs better on AoE than [Toxic Thorn Footwraps](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr/item=193452/toxic-thorn-footwraps) and is within margin of error on ST.\
[Toxified](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr/item=193552/toxified-armor-patch) increases the effect of Slimy and Thorns by 100% meaning that this embellishment does nothing unless you already have the boots equipped.\
There is no rush to crafting anything, if you have sparks it is wise to hold on to them until release in case of any late tuning.

## [What is my AoE rotation?](#aoe)

</div>

    - You have a {{< spell 393942 "Starweaver's Warp" >}} proc.
    - {{< spell 202345 "Starlord" >}} is below 3 stacks.
- Use {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}} if you have an {{< spell 393760 "Umbral Embrace" >}} proc and you will not overcap on AP.
- Use {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" >}} if you have a {{< spell 393944 "Starweaver's Weft" >}} proc and {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}} will hit less than 3 targets.
- Use {{< spell 202347 "Stellar Flare" >}} if the target will live for at least 8s+1s per target that {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}} can hit and you will not overcap on AP. Don't use this above 11 targets -1 per talent in Umbral Intensity or Astral Smolder.
- Use {{< spell 400636 "Astral Communion" >}} if you will not overcap on AP.
- Use {{< spell 391528 "Convoke the Spirits" >}} if {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}} would only hit 2 targets, otherwise only use {{< spell 391528 "Convoke" >}} for movement in AoE.

- Use {{< spell 194153 "Wrath" >}} if {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}} will only hit 2 targets.
- Use {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}}.


<div id="filler">

## [What is my filler priority inside CA/Inc?](#filler)

</div>


Inside of {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}}/{{< spell 102560 "Inc" >}} your fillers will be {{< spell 190984 "Wrath" >}} on Single Target and {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}} on 3 or more targets.

 
 <div id="mushroom">

## [How do we use Wild Mushrooms and how do they work?](#mushroom)
 
{{< spell 88747 "Wild Mushroom" >}} deals damage in an explosion and then applies a DOT  called {{< spell 392999 "Fungal Growth" >}}(if talented). This DOT lasts for 8 seconds and deals 70% of the explosions damage over the course of its duration. {{< spell 88747 "Wild Mushroom" >}} has 3 charges, so if all 3 charges are used in quick succession and each apply a dot dealing 1000 damage, the total damage dealt by the DOT would be 3000 (1000 damage x 3 charges), and the duration of the DOT would be refreshed to 8 seconds.

This type of DOT is often called "Ignite" based on a Mage spell working this exact way. You dont lose/gain any Fungal Growth damage by staggering them or pressing them all at once.

On single target, it's best to use all 3 charges at once paired with any available buffs such as potion, trinkets, CA. {{< spell 88747 "Wild Mushroom" >}} is also an instant GCD, so it can be used for movement as needed.

In AoE scenarios, you can use the charges all at once for a quick burst of damage or stagger them to get {{< spell 393956 "Waning Twilight" >}} up.

In Mythic+, it's best to stagger the charges to get {{< spell 393956 "Waning Twilight" >}} up on all mobs before you've managed to apply {{< spell 202347 "Stellar Flare" >}}.

</div>

## Talents for different target counts
When we don't need Starfall we can talent it away to gain Nature's Balance and Warrior of Elune which is slightly outperforming Treants:
<br>[Single target](https://mimiron.raidbots.com/simbot/render/talents/BYGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFASSEBEJkkEJRKCtEHIRSUS0kcgQolUSCR0AoAAA?bgcolor=000000)

## Raid Talents
TBD

## Dungeon Talents
The following are dungeon talent builds that will always serve you well but mind that there can be some variations based on your group comp or affixes.
  
TBD
  
### Dungeon Druid Tree Considerations
  
- Ursine Vigor, Well-Honed Instincts and Improved Stampeding Roar are the major competing talents. Ursine Vigor should be taken if you need it to survive certain abilities. Well-Honed Instincts is always on 1 point but a 2nd can be taken if you rarely/never use Bear Form. Improved Stampeding Roar is extremely useful in indoor dungeons and in spiteful weeks.
- Remove Corruption should be taken in Afflicted weeks and in every dungeon except Vortex Pinnacle, as we lose nothing relevant by taking it.
- Cyclone has basically no use other than stopping Bursting and can be replaced with anything else(which also won't have any use).
- Hibernate can be used for Incorporeal affix.
- For lower keys you can put 2 points into Feline Swiftness like [this](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/render/talents/BYGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFASERQSkgkEJRKCtEHAAAAAAAAAA?bgcolor=000000). This skips Ursine Vigor and Typhoon.
- All other talents in the druid tree are more or less set.


<div id="consumables">

# [4.Consumables:](#consumables)

</div>


<div id="potions">

## [Potions](#Potions)

</div>


[Elemental Potion of Ultimate Power](https://www.wowhead.com/item=191383/elemental-potion-of-ultimate-power) for every situation. Potion of Elemental Power is only 0.4% worse if it turns out to be far cheaper.


<div id="food">

## [Food](#food)

</div>


[Grand Banquet of the Kalu'ak](https://www.wowhead.com/item=197794/grand-banquet-of-the-kaluak) in every situation, but [Sizzling Seafood Medley](https://www.wowhead.com/item=197784/sizzling-seafood-medley) is a cheaper close contender. 


<div id="phials">

## [Phials](#Phials)

</div>

**ST**

Pure damage wise with 100% uptime on all of the Phials and not counting in the downsides their hierarchy is as follows on ST:

- [Iced Phial of Corrupting Rage](https://www.wowhead.com/item=191329/iced-phial-of-corrupting-rage)
- [Phial of Static Empowerment](https://www.wowhead.com/item=191338/phial-of-static-empowerment), has ~55% of the value of Corrupting Rage Phial at 100% uptime.
- [Phial of Charged Isolation](https://www.wowhead.com/item=191332/phial-of-charged-isolation), has ~55% of the value of Corrupting Rage Phial at 100% uptime.
- [Phial of Elemental Chaos](https://www.wowhead.com/item=191359/phial-of-elemental-chaos), has the same value as Corrupting Rage at 60% uptime. This means if you can't get more than 60% uptime you should use this Phial.
- [Phial of Tepid Versatility](https://www.wowhead.com/item=191341/phial-of-tepid-versatility), same as the Elemental one, only that vers is more often better during progress than the random stats. Should be the default phial in most situations.
- [Phial of Glacial Fury](https://www.wowhead.com/item=191335/phial-of-glacial-fury), after nerfs this Phial should never be used.

**AoE**:

The priority is the same as it is on ST.


<div id="runes">

## [Runes](#Runes)

<div id="embellishments">

## [Embellishments](#embellishments)

</div>

**ST:**
The best embellishments raw damage wise at full uptime are [Elemental Lariat](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=375323/elemental-lariat) and [Slimy Expulsion Boots](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193451/slimy-expulsion-boots). 
<br>[Potion Absorption Inhibitor](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371700/potion-absorption-inhibitor) should usually be taken instead of Slimy Expulsion Boots since swapping Embellishments, at least early on, is not an option easily.
<br>Another option is [Blue Silken Lining](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=387335/blue-silken-lining) at very high uptime, which should can be considered when you are sure you will rarely fall below 90%. In raid this is never the case and the same goes for most dungeons.

**AOE:**
The best embellishments  are [Elemental Lariat](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=375323/elemental-lariat) and [Potion Absorption Inhibitor](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371700/potion-absorption-inhibitor) in nearly all situations. 
<br>As for single target [Blue Silken Lining](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=387335/blue-silken-lining) is an option if it gets very high uptime but this is essentially never the case.

**TLDR:** 
[Elemental Lariat](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=375323/elemental-lariat) (always use) > [Slimy Expulsion Boots](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193451/slimy-expulsion-boots) (ST) = [Potion Absorption Inhibitor](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371700/potion-absorption-inhibitor) (AoE)

**What to craft:**
Before you make your decision on what to craft you should clear as much of the raid as possible. All crafted pieces should be crafted with mastery/haste.
<br>Your first craft should be [Elemental Lariat](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193001/elemental-lariat?bonus=8960:8782:8793&ilvl=418&spec=102), it performs really well in all situations, after that you can choose to craft either of the following depending on your gear:
<br>[Signet of Titanic Insight](https://www.wowhead.com/item=192999/signet-of-titanic-insight) Ring crafted by jewelcrafting
<br>[Primal Molten Spellblade](https://www.wowhead.com/item=190506/primal-molten-spellblade) 1H dagger crafted by blacksmithing
<br>[Life-Bound Boots](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193398/life-bound-boots) Boots crafted by leatherworking



<div id="tier-set">

## [Tier Set](#tier-set)

T29 2PC: 2.6% DPS ST, 3.5% AoE 
<br>T29 2PC+4PC: 4% DPS ST, 5.5% AoE
<br>
<br>2PC+2PC: 6.7% DPS ST, 9.1% AoE
<br>
<br>T30 2PC: 4% DPS ST, 5.6% AoE
<br>T30 2PC+4PC: 10.1% DPS ST, 11.6% AoE
 
<br> This means that you won't break T29 4PC until you can equip 2PC+2PC or you looted a high itemlevel piece in two/three tierslots. (depending on how many of the T29 tierpieces you have)

## [Trinkets](#trinkets)

On Single Target you will want to use [Furious Ragefeather](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193677/furious-ragefeather?bonus=7974&class=11&ilvl=415&spec=102) and one of the following trinkets:

<br>[Desperate Invoker's Codex](https://www.wowhead.com/item=194310/desperate-invokers-codex?bonus=7935) - Raszageth (Raid), Inflicts a great amount of damage to yourself and should not be considered in a progression environment.

<br>[Idol of the Earth Warder](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193006/idol-of-the-earth-warder?class=11&ilvl=418&spec=102) - Jewelcrafting / AH !! This trinket is only good if you have a lot of sockets in your gear !!

## [Gearing Advice](#gearing-advice)

</div>

In general try to hit ilvl > mastery gear. If it has mastery it is most likely good, it does NOT need haste or anything else. For stuff that does not have mastery just sim in between dungeons.

**Dungeons to Spam:**

TBD

**Dungeons to Reroll:**

TBD

# [6. Miscellaneous:](#misc)

<div id="snapshot">

## [Do our dots snapshot?](#snapshot)

</div>

No, all of our periodic damage (like {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}}, {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" >}}, {{< spell 202347 "Stellar Flare " >}}) does NOT snapshot, everything is dynamic. That means any dots gain/lose the damage bonus upon entering/leaving the Eclipse that buffs them and whenever any other stat/damage increases are applied/expire.




<div id="owlkin-frenzy">

## [How do I use Owlkin Frenzy procs?](#owlkin-frenzy)

</div>

When Lunar Eclipse is active use {{< spell 157228 "Owlkin Frenzy" >}} procs as soon as possible. When ONLY Solar Eclipse(should currently never be the case) is active, use it when fighting 3+ targets or when you need to move. Otherwise let it expire.





<div id="astral-damage">
 
## [What is Astral damage?](#astral-damage)

</div>

Astral damage is Arcane and Nature damage at the same time meaning that these spells benefit from effects that buff either spell school and get increased by both type of boosts multiplicatively. Mind that class buffs only affect class spells so if a trinket does nature or arcane damage they are not affected by our buffs to these spell classes.
