**DRAGONFLIGHT TALENTS:**



[Single Target](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/talent-calc/druid/balance/DAQFFQVQcCYBQUExRQQBFNUYRQUGZVFRGUQCVQ)


[Single Target with Add Waves](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/talent-calc/druid/balance/DAQEFAUQcCQhQUUxlQQBBNUYRQUGYVVVCUQCUA) - (most raid boss fights)


[aoe 2t council sustained](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/talent-calc/druid/balance/DAQFEQRQcCYBQUUxVQQBBNUYVQUGYVVEWQQCUA) - 5 minute Patchwerk


[aoe 3t council sustained](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/talent-calc/druid/balance/DAQFEQRQcCYBQUUxVQQBBNUYZQUGYVVEGQQCUA) - 5 minute Patchwerk




[aoe 4t+ council sustained](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/talent-calc/druid/balance/DAQFEQRQcCYBQUUxVQQBBNUYZQUGYVVEGQQCUA) - 5 minute Patchwerk


[M+ build](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/talent-calc/druid/balance/DAQEFAUQcCQhUUUxVQQBBNUYlUUGYVVECQQCUA)




DRUID TREE DEVIATIONS:

- ALWAYS hit Natureâ€™s Vigil in raid and M+ unless the content is a joke.
- IF you are pure ST and do not need any other utility, you can hit Nature Recovery and Thick Hide, while getting everything else other than Astral Influence, use [this talent tree](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/talent-calc/druid/balance/DAQFFQVQcCYBQUExRQQBBAA).
- If you have to pick utility, or want any other point than the build above, start by cutting the resto parts of the tree like in [this example](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/talent-calc/druid/balance/DAQEFAUQcCQhQUUxRQQBBAA). 
- From this point onwards, you can pick either Feline Swiftness, another point in WHI, 1-minute roar, typhoon and so on. 
- If you want more points, to cut the least defensive from your build you would have to cut Renewal if only one point was needed, if two points are needed, cut Incap roar and WHI and if you want more than that swap spec. 
- If you need Decurse inside of an m+ dungeon, use [this build](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/talent-calc/druid/balance/DAQFFQVQcCQhQUUxQQQBBNUYlUUGYVVECQQCUA).
- If you for some reason still want typhoon, then use [this build](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/talent-calc/druid/balance/DAQFEQRQcCQhUUUxRQQBBNUYlUUGYVVECQQCUA).

## [Potions](#Potions)

</div>


[Elemental Potion of Ultimate Power](https://www.wowhead.com/item=191383/elemental-potion-of-ultimate-power) for every situation.


<div id="food">

## [Food](#food)

</div>


[Grand Banquet of the Kalu'ak](https://www.wowhead.com/item=197794/grand-banquet-of-the-kaluak) in every situation, but [Sizzling Seafood Medley](https://www.wowhead.com/item=197784/sizzling-seafood-medley) is a cheaper close contender. 


<div id="phials">

## [Phials](#Phials)

</div>

**ST**

Pure damage wise with 100% uptime on all of the Phials and not counting in the downsides their hierarchy is as follows on Single Target:

- [Phial of Static Empowerment](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=191338/phial-of-static-empowerment)
- [Phial of Charged Isolation](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=191332/phial-of-charged-isolation)

## [Stat Priority:](#stats)

</div>

Sim yourself using [Raidbots Top Gear](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear). Do not follow any stat priorities.



<div id="embellishments">

## [Embellishments](#embellishments)

</div>

**ST:**
The best embellishments raw damage wise at full uptime are [Elemental Lariat](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=375323/elemental-lariat) and [Bronzed Grip Wrappings](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=396442/bronzed-grip-wrappings). 
<br>A close contender is [Blue Silken Lining](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=387335/blue-silken-lining) at full uptime, which should in my opinion not be considered on pure ST.
<br>[Potion Absorption Inhibitor](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371700/potion-absorption-inhibitor) and [Thriving Thorns](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=379396/thriving-thorns) are the next two best options, so I would recommend one of these two.

**AOE:**
The best embellishments raw damage wise, at full uptime are [Elemental Lariat](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=375323/elemental-lariat) and [Blue Silken Lining](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=387335/blue-silken-lining). 
<br>A close contender is [Potion Absorption Inhibitor](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371700/potion-absorption-inhibitor), so I would recommend just sticking with this and [Elemental Lariat](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=375323/elemental-lariat) for anything AOE, unless you are reclearing an easy fight.
<br>[Potion Absorption Inhibitor](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371700/potion-absorption-inhibitor)

**TLDR:** 
[Elemental Lariat](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=375323/elemental-lariat) (always use) > [Bronzed Grip Wrappings](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=396442/bronzed-grip-wrappings) (ST) = [Potion Absorption Inhibitor](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371700/potion-absorption-inhibitor) (AoE) > [Blue Silken Lining](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=387335/blue-silken-lining) (controlled environment)


<div id="tier-set">

## [Tier Set](#tier-set)

2PC: 2% DPS ST, 2.5% AoE 
<br>4PC: 12% DPS ST, 12.5% AoE
<br>TLDR: Loot or bench

How to use the 4PC procs can be found in the [Rotation](#rotation) section. ({{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" >}} ST, {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" >}} AoE)

<div id="gearing-advice">

## [Gearing Advice](#gearing-advice)

</div>

In general try to hit Ilvl > Mastery gear. If it has mastery it is most likely good, it does NOT need haste or anything else. For stuff that does not have mastery just sim in between dungeons.

**Dungeons to Spam:**

Nokund Offensive - In general insane loot, really good trinket, a lot of mastery gear. If you are pugging keys and are able to target, try to soft spam this dungeon.
<br>Halls of Valor - This dungeon is really heavy on mastery gear and the trinkets are also pretty good. Do not reroll this dungeon.
<br>Algeth'Ar Academy - Good for weapon hunting, it has a low drop pool so you can get it relatively fast
<br>Court of Stars - Although the loot pool is diluted, Signet of Melandrus is around 400 agility for Feral if you will at all play that. Infernal Writ is also a really solid trinket. 
<br>Temple of the Jade Serpent - Although the loot pool is diluted, there are some decent pieces and a really good mainhand. Do not go out of your way to spam this, but do not reroll this either.

**Dungeons to Reroll:**

<br>Shadowmoon Burial Grounds - Unless the Loot table gets purged a lot on live, try to reroll this dungeon, as you can not target most of the loot and mainstat jewelry is worse than normal one.
<br>Ruby Life Pools - Good for weapon if you do not have one yet, otherwise skip unless someone in your group needs this or you need score
<br>Azure Vault - Mostly garbage loot, skip unless someone in your group needs this or you need score



<div id="misc">

# [6. Miscellaneous:](#misc)

</div>


<div id="snapshot">

## [Do our dots snapshot?](#snapshot)

</div>

No, all of our periodic damage (like {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}}, {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" >}}, {{< spell 202347 "Stellar Flare " >}}) does NOT snapshot, everything is dynamic. That means any dots gain/lose the damage bonus upon entering/leaving the Eclipse that buffs them and whenever any other stat/damage increases are applied/expire.




<div id="owlkin-frenzy">

## [How do I use Owlkin Frenzy procs?](#owlkin-frenzy)

</div>

When Lunar Eclipse is active use {{< spell 157228 "Owlkin Frenzy" >}} procs as soon as possible. When ONLY Solar Eclipse is active, use it when fighting 3+ targets or when you need to move. Otherwise let it expire.





<div id="astral-damage">
 
## [What is Astral damage?](#astral-damage)

</div>

Astral damage is Arcane and Nature damage at the same time meaning that these spells benefit from effects that buff either spell school and double dip whenever effects that buff both are active. Mind that class buffs only affect class spells so if a trinket does nature or arcane damage they are not affected by our buffs to these spell classes.
