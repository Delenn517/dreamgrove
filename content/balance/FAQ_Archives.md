# 2. Information Dump

## Boat Openers

Night Fae - with BoAT (with NB):<br/> {{< spell 190984 "Wrath" >}}, Wrath, {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" >}}, Starsurge, dots, {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}}, Convoke, Starsurge until you have no more AsP

## BOAT NF ST rotation

**Pure Single Target with {{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}}:**

- If you have {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}} and {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}} off cooldown, then use them both together (refer to [#19](#swifty-macro)) when below 40 AP. For cooldown usage refer to [#9](#convoke-delay). Without Convoke use CA at 90+ AsP on cd.

- Transition into the next Eclipse if you are currently not in one, preferring Solar Eclipse when possible.

- Dump as many {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" >}} as possible in the first globals of each Eclipse. The goal should be that the first 3 globals are always 3 Starsurges.

- Refresh {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}} / {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" >}} / {{< spell 202347 "Stellar Flare " >}} if:
    - The first 3 Starsurges are not being delayed.
    - You are currently inside an Eclipse.
    - The specific dot is below 30% of its base duration (pandemic window).

- Use Starsurge if you are going to overcap and will not lose one of your 3 Starsurges at the start of the next Eclipse. Up to 10 Astral Power can be overcapped in each Eclipse. If you overcapped more use Starsurge earlier in that situation.

- Use {{< spell 190984 "Wrath" >}} (inside Solar Eclipse) or {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}} (inside Lunar Eclipse) until you reach the next Eclipse.

**Notes:**

- Maximizing Eclipse uptime allows you to maximize BoAT and {{< spell 343647 "Solstice" >}} uptime.

- With {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}} use up all of your Astral Power in the previous Eclipse so that you enter the next Eclipse with less than 40 Astral Power and can cast {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}}.

- Having around 70 AsP at the end of an Eclipse is usually enough to be able to triple Starsurge at the start of the next Eclipse.


## Old Aoe version

**AoE (with {{< spell 114107 "Soul of the Forest" >}}+{{< spell 202354 "Stellar Drift" >}}) starting at 2 targets:**

**Any situation:**

- Keep {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" >}} permanently up above anything else.

- Keep {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" >}} permanently up. If the mobs aren't stacked yet wait with this until they are.

**Outside any Eclipse:**

- Refresh {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}} outside of Eclipse if and only if ALL of the following are true:
    - The next eclipse you will enter is Lunar Eclipse
    - All targets can be hit by {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}}
    - There are 5 or less targets
    - All targets will live through the entire Lunar Eclipse
    - You will not lose Starfall uptime

- Enter the next Eclipse if in no Eclipse, preferring Lunar Eclipse.

**Lunar Eclipse and both Eclipses (CA/Inc):**

- Use {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" >}} to stop yourself from overcapping AsP until 6 targets at which point you should overcap.

- Refresh Moonfire if you are at 4 targets or below if the targets will live through the next Eclipse.

- Spam Starfire.

**Solar Eclipse:**

- Use Starsurge to stop yourself from overcapping AsP.

- Keep Moonfire up between 1 and 10 targets if they live through the next Eclipse and you won't lose Starfall uptime by doing so.

- Starfire when 5 targets can be hit by it, increased by 1 target for every 20% mastery you have.

- Spam {{< spell 190984 "Wrath" >}}.

**Notes:**

- This should be used as a priority, going from top to bottom.
