## **P1**
**Roars:**
<br>Alternate between druids: 1st 3rd 5th Winds and 2nd 4th Winds. 
**Barkskins:** 
- If you get 1st bomb use it there, if not then it use on 2nd bomb even if you did not get targeted.
- Use on the 4th bomb on overlap. Make sure to preposition yourself into your spot for orbs.

**Incarn:** Pull / hold for intermission

**Pulsar: **
You need to have 560+ pulsar for the start of 1st intermission, you will stop a bit after 5th bombs if you are 100ish wipes into the fight, but if you need to stop after your Pulsar procs because your group does not have enough damage yet push in some stellar flares in between, as it does little to no direct damage and it is your fastest AP builder. 

<br>**FoE:** 
<br>Here you just want to press them on cd and have it up for intermission pulsar/incarn. You can try to line them up with p1 pulsars if you are able to or line it up with boat windows right after entering a lunar eclipse. If you are able to, use it when you do not have to go cat/bear form because you will not get the bonus damage from moonkin form.

<br>**Winds:**
<br>Solving winds is pretty easy if you put a bit of research time into it. If your boss is properly turned around on every wind it is very easy. You want to shift into cat form, hold W from the time the winds start and press Wild Charge right before maximum range (This is around the outer golden ring, try it a bit on 1st winds as you do not need WC for those then do it in the same position every time.). This will put you in range of boss and will make it very easy for you to move into position on winds 1-3. On winds 4 you will have to move a bit after the winds. You have to most likely cycle eclipse here, you most of the time are allowed to do that unless a healer cd was missed. On winds 5 you want to bear form charge in the middle of the platform, then take gateway and slide into your position. Until after winds 2 you can take gateway in whatever way u want, it will come back up for winds5.

<br>**Motes:**
<br>Here you simply move into position. If you are an outer position use Typhoon into Incapacitating Roar, whenever your mote spawns, as your orb will get pushed in front of you most of the time. To make it a bit better, you can press backpedal as your mote is spawning, typhoon when it appeared (this will make it more likely to get pushed in front of you) and then press w after your typhoon goes off and at the end of the global press incapacitating roar. This makes your roar hit more motes. If you have a ring of frost assigned on your position, backpedal out of it and push your mote into it with typhoon, as it has a chance to push it behind you if it gets hit by ring first. Use Solar Beam if you see any up after your typhoon>roar. 

<br>**Bombs:**
<br>If you have a bomb, move out of the group and have one of the following, then use Bear Form: 
- You are below 90% HP with no external or Barkskin,
- You are below 70% HP with a weak external or Barkskin
- You are below 50% HP (your healers suck) > HP POT [You NEED to use one in p1 up until last motes, (NOT healthstone)]

<br>**Wild Charges:**
<br>You are only allowed to use Wild charge in these spots: 
- Before or right after a bomb (2 globals after bomb max)
- On winds


## Intermission1:**
Here you want to have prepared: Potion, 1 Wrath into Lunar Eclipse, 20-28 shs, 560 AP pulsar, barkskin, Renewal, Incarnation, FoE, 3 mushrooms. 
Rotation from before you get knocked: Engi boots, Moonfire right add, Moonfire middle add, LAND, Wrath, Starfall 3x (4x if shs was above 26), Sunfire, Mushroom, Starfall (2x of OB), FoE, Moonfire 2x, Starfall, Incarn, Mushroom, Moonfire, Starfall, then continue with what feels right until next add. at the end of add2 or start of add3 u need to proc your pulsar. It depends on which breath rotation you get. Do not use your 2nd Foe in this phase, as it will not come back up for your pulsar in 1st shield.
Barkskin: Before 1st shields on 1st add, then hold for p2. If your group is not pushing 2nd shield, use it there. 

Roars: Alternate 2nd breath and 3rd breath beween druids, Windrush 1st breath. 


## **P2:** 
<br>ASAP get into Eclipse so you get a 4p proc before shield that u can proc your pulsar with. Have around 450Pulsar so that you get your pulsar right on shield. Use Foe on shield after pulsar proc. After that use all FoEs on shields. 
<br>Incarnation: 2nd shield
<br>Barkskin: Shields
<br>Renewal: on demand whenever you need it. 
<br>Bombs: If gods picked you, run out,  bearform > frenzied regen, healthstone if needed > walk back in range of healers. 
<br>HP Pot: Around last motes whenever you need it, if you are low before, prepop, if not then use after motes. 
<br>Wild Charge: You jump the lightning circle with Catform Wild Charge. Make sure you are far enough from boss to be able to use it. If you are too close it will not go off.
<br>Mushrooms: Pool up all charges for shields, but keep one for intermission2 adds on last shield. 
<br>Fury of Elune: Use only inside shields.

## **Intermission2:**
<br>Here you want to only play for objectives. If you have to roar melee camp, concentrate on that and do not get hit, if you have to bait a breath do not do a bad job at it, if you have to root concentrate on that.
<br>You want to have all cds up for last phase.
<br>This phase is pretty straight forward, just play objectives and win. Cycle roars on Breaths.
<br>Mass Root 1: (Druid1) Use this whenever all the adds are in the middle. If no adds get slowed, they will stop in place for 0.5s whenever they reach the middle of the platform. That is when you want to root.
<br>Mass Root 2: (Druid2) Use this whenever the 2nd set meets the 1st set, this one should not be a problem, but you can always use Ring of Frost or Ring of Peace to make it a bit easier.
<br>Mass Root 3: (Druid3) This will become available around 2-3 seconds after the 2nd set reaches the middle. Make sure to pay attention if Root2 hit every add, if not you can patch it up with Root3.

## **P3:**
<br>Pop everything at the start. Dot everything and cycle eclipse first, then pop Inc asap do not wait for a full pulsar proc to use it, you will get a 2nd Inc later in the fight.
<br>Roars: Alternate Roars like in P1 but on grips instead of winds.
<br>Barkskin: 2nd Grip, 4th Grip
<br>Renewal: On demand.
<br>Healthpot: Late in the phase, around 10:20 whenever it comes off CD on demand. 
<br>Healthstone: On demand, as late as possible.
