## Notes For the Boss:
- Looks like an insane venthyr fight until 2lego and maybe even after. 

## Mythic only notes:
- Venthyr and SD in general are insane in intermission.
- Mass root is usable on adds in lower realm if needed.
- You have 2.5 eclipse cycles until the first inside phase. You might want to prepop cds a bit if on 2lego if the adds are dying too fast (We gripped all 5 together and they died in 10sec.)
