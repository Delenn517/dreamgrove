## Notes For the Boss:
- Covenant: Venthyr is insanely strong here, but NF is also playable. 
- Barkskin every 2nd Hopebreaker
- Incarn pull/LK1/LK2/end if possible
- For LK venthyr ramps I started at 10 sec left on the 2nd abomination spawn. (this was with sinful no tier)

## Mythic only notes:
- Nobody killed this yet :)
