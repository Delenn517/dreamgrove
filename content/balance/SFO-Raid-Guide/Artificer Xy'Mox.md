## Notes For the Boss:
- Covenants: If you are required to do more damage in the intermissions Venthyr is a clear winner. Otherwise both perform Venthyr and NF perform similarly. If a skip is needed you default to Venthyr.

- Barkskin on cd on the spread circlces, there is nothing particularly threatening.


## Mythic only notes:
- Venthyr looks very strong here for the portal phases ALTHOUGH if you use RF on the first add phase you will not have it for the 2nd one and you will be forced to pop the 2nd one on boss to be able to get 3 usages in the fight (ON PTR). I used RF Inc when the first portals spawned and i had exactly 10sec to burst down the adds on the other platform. This allowed me to get a full duration Starfall and use FoE at 8sec after they got stacked and we basically 3manned the first one with 2 Boomie 1 WW without lust.

## Talents:

- SD for all covenants and maybe FoE for Kyr and NF aswell.
- You could run Might Bash if you feel like you really need stuns in the intermission.
