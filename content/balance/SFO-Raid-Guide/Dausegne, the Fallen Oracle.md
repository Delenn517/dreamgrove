## Notes For the Boss:
- Covenants: Both NF and Venthyr work to skip the circles but Door makes it a bit easier and has a lower cooldown. Either covenant works and there won't be any relevant differences between them.

- Barkskin either the circles or the soaks, dont think much about it.
- As Venthyr take double door.
- Always try to move into the circles whenever they come out and premove into (or close to) the first one. 
- Pool AsP for add spawns to Starfall and burst them down as soon as possible.

## Mythic only notes:
- More circles and more adds not really much else going on. Raises Venthyr value by a tiny bit.
