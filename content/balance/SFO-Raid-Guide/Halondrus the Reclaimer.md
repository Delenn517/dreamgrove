## Notes For the Boss:
- **They completely reworked the boss. This information is most likely not up to date.**
- On PTR HC the boss felt like you would want to go for NF with how little hp the pillars had plus the fact that the boss had a huge dr depending on how many pillars were up. *also read mythic*
- You can always starfall for movement it is not much of a loss. If you are playing sd pulsar remember that you proc pulsar with starfall.

## Mythic only notes:
- On PTR Mythic the pillars had more hp. They lasted around 15sec for us. You could also chain 2 pillars one after the other making venthyr the go to until 2lego, at which point you go for kyrian. The boss also did not have the dr from before which means that you can aoe down the boss at the same time as the pillars,  reinforcing venthyr.
- Barkskin the shapes (mythic mechanic).
