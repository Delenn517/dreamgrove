## Notes For the Boss:
- Covenant: 50/50 ven nf split depending what u like more both are fine.
- If you can get your raid to delay the Bloodlust in P3 a bit you can use everything on cooldown and get 3 uses. Otherwise save CDs for P3.
- In the intermissions really try to maximise your time spend casting by positioning yourself well and using Starfall whenever you need it.
- Barkskin on cd and if you have it up on Reclaim casts.
