## Notes For the Boss:
- Covenant: Venthyr has better P3 damage which will make it the superior Covenant if you lack damage there. Otherwise both covenants perform fairly similarly and neither has a clear edge.
- If you can get your raid to delay the Bloodlust in P3 a bit you can use everything on cooldown and get 3 uses. Otherwise save CDs for P3.
- In the intermissions really try to maximise your time spend casting by positioning yourself well and using Starfall whenever you need it.

## Mythic only notes:
- On PTR Mythic the pillars had more hp. They lasted around 15sec for us. You could also chain 2 pillars one after the other making venthyr the go to. The boss also did not have the dr from before which means that you can aoe down the boss at the same time as the pillars, reinforcing venthyr.
- Barkskin the shapes (mythic mechanic).
