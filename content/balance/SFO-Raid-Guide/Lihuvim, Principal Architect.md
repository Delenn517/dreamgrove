## Notes For the Boss:
- Covenant: Either covenant works here and which one you want depends on what kind of damage you are missing. You lose a lot of Frenzy value if you use it to burst down the spawning add but Frenzy is far superior when you need more damage to cleave down all the adds that spawn.

- Barkskin every intermission.


## Mythic only notes:
- The patterns for the whole fight were: orbs, clear, intermission, orbs, clear, intermission. with 20sec(ish) until 1st intermission from pull and 3min exactly from pull to 2nd intermission. 2min and a bit between intermissions (dont know the exact timer). As NF you could get a convoke+pulsar for every intermission phase. 
- My cd usage on NF was: inc when first orbs appeared, convoke first intermission, convoke again after the intermission on cd (lined up with pulsar), pulsar proc, inc + convoke + pulsar for next intermission, convoke again after the intermission on cd, convoke+pulsar in intermission, inc a bit after adds died, repeat.

## Talents:

- SD is very strong for movement esp if you are NF you will take it even if the strat is 100% ST.
