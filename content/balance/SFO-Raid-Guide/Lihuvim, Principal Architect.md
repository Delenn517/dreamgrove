## Notes For the Boss:
- Covenant: Either covenant works here and which one you want depends on what kind of damage you are missing. You will not be able to burst down the intermission adds, but Frenzy is far superior when you need more damage for after intermission.
- Barkskin every intermission.
- CDs either after intermissions or on CD for boss this is very dependant on your group. Start with holding for after first intermission then go from there. Try to use CDs with Bloodlust.
