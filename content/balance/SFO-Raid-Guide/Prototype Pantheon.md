## Notes For the Boss:
- Covenant: Venthyr>NF. Venthyr is really strong for p3 and cardinal adds. I felt that the only redeemable factor of NF was that it has good overall add damage as on ptr venthyr did not have cds for every set and we held 2nd cds for p3.
- All 4 cardinal adds are starfall cleavable at the start if you stand in the middle, then sidestep and hit the 3 back ones. One add should be stacked on boss so the melee can cleave it down. You always focus these as a moonkin.
- Barkskin the Night Hunters and the spread.
