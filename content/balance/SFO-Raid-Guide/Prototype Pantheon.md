## Notes For the Boss:
- Covenant: Venthyr will generally outperform NF here as it is really strong for P3 and the cardinal adds. The only upside Night Fae has is that it can more often burst down add spawns.

- All 4 cardinal adds are Starfall cleavable at the start if you stand in the middle. Once you can't stand in the middle anymore, go towards the back of the room and hit the 3 adds where the boss is not standing. One add should be stacked on boss so the melee can cleave it down.
- Barkskin the Night Hunters and the spread.
