## Notes For the Boss:
- Covenant: Both NF and Venthyr are playable but neither have an edge. Which one pulls ahead will depend on kill time.

- Barkskin whenever you are soaking. Each phase should be around 1.5min each soak being around 30s. This can be tracked with his mana bar (sets come at the same time as the tank mechanic). If you are soaking 2nd you might be able to also Barkskin the group borrow as that also does a significant ammount of damage.
- As NF be careful to not stand too far away from the boss as its range is counted from the center of the bosses hitbox unlike all other spells. 
- Try to not kill your melee by standing too close to the boss and baiting a puddle where they want to move.

## Mythic only notes:
- Mythic does not change that much compared to hc for us, it just gets more claustrophobic.

## Talents:

- If you have troubles with movement, talent Stellar Drift and use Starfall whenever you need it.
- Guardian Affinity will have increased value due to the bursty damage patterns.
