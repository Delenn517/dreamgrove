## Notes For the Boss:
- Barkskin every tank soak, as they do the most damage and are every minute, lining up with skin cd every time. 
- Hold Health Pot and Healthstone for Energy Cores.
- Nadjia will probably be the pick on progression, as it is a 5 minute hard enrage and you can line up euphoria and INC+RF at around 4 minutes into the fight.

## Mythic only notes:
TBD

## Talents:

- Purely Single Target boss. Not much to swap around. 
- Guardian Affinity is recommended due to the bursty pattern of the boss.
