## Notes For the Boss:
- Barkskin the pillar breaks.
- Look out for fulldotting adds that are not near the boss.
- Look out for Solar Beams on adds far from group.
- Prioritise Starfall over everything else.
- Sunfire the small adds if they are stacked no matter how fast they die.
- Place yourself around the middle of the room if possible in order to cleave the whole room with Starfall.
- CD Usage: Pull / another cd inside a main phase / p3 with lust

## Mythic only notes:
TBD

## Talents:
- I would personally recommend Stellar Drift for HEROIC, as the adds die way too fast for Twin Moons to get any value.
