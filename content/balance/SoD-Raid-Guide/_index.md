Summary
===
Welcome to the Sanctum of Domination Balance Druid encounter guide.

**DISCLAIMER:** This is a WORK IN PROGRESS guide and will be constantly updated as I, Chicken, experience the fights. You should NOT copy the guide and instead make an opinion for yourself and try to elevate your level of play by combining some niche fight specific mechanics mentioned in the guide.
<br>Current guide progression: 9.5/10M - Fate+KT coming after Sylv

You can ask me any questions on discord ChickenWingz#7777 or just ask in the Dreamgrove Balance channel.
