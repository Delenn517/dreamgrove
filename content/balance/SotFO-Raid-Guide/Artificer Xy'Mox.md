## Notes For the Boss:
- Covenants: Venthyr or Kyrian most likely as NF falls off more than the other two on aoe and does not really bring anything special but it is by no means unplayable. If a skip is needed on live (although I do not think it will be necessary) you default to Venthyr.
- Barkskin on cd on the spread circlces, there is nothing particularly threatening.


## Mythic only notes:
- Venthyr looks very strong here for the portal phases ALTHOUGH if you use RF on the first add phase you will not have it for the 2nd one and you will be forced to pop the 2nd one on boss to be able to get 3 usages in the fight (ON PTR). I used RF Inc when the first portals spawned and i had exactly 10sec to burst down the adds on the other platform. This allowed me to get a full duration Starfall and use FoE at 8sec after they got stacked and we basically 3manned the first one with 2 Boomie 1 WW without lust.

## Talents:

- SD for all covenants and maybe FoE for Kyr and NF aswell.
- You could maybe run bash if you feel like you really need stuns in the intermission.
