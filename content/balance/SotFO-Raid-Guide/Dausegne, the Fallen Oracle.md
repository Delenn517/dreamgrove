## Notes For the Boss:
- Covenants: NF and Venthyr look like the winners here because of Door and Soulshape, as you will want to skip as many circles as you can to reduce the raid damage.
- Barkskin either the circles or the soaks, dont think much about it.
- As Venthyr take double door.
- Always try to move into the circles whenever they come out and premove into (or close to) the first one. 
- Try to save a starfall for add spawns and ap in general to burst it down asap.
