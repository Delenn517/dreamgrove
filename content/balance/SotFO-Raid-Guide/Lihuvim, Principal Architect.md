## Notes For the Boss:
- Both NF and Kyrian looked very strong. Venthyr was not as good imo because of the dmg pattern. At least with our start it was not that great, if you were cleaving 2+ adds post intermission and had to do it fast then venthyr will rise in value.
- NF if you need to demolish adds in intermission, Kyrian if you need more sustained dmg on boss.
- Barkskin every intermission.


## Mythic only notes:
- The patterns for the whole fight were: orbs, clear, intermission, orbs, clear, intermission. with 20sec(ish) until 1st intermission from pull and 3min exactly from pull to 2nd intermission. 2min and a bit between intermissions (dont know the exact timer). As NF you could get a convoke+pulsar for every intermission phase. 
- My cd usage on NF was: inc when first orbs appeared, convoke first intermission, convoke again after the intermission on cd (lined up with pulsar), pulsar proc, inc + convoke + pulsar for next intermission, convoke again after the intermission on cd, convoke+pulsar in intermission, inc a bit after adds died, repeat.

## Talents:

- SD is very strong for movement esp if you are NF you will take it even if the strat is 100% ST.
