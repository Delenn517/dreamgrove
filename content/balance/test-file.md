## 10.2 News
### Tier Set
> 2p: When Eclipse ends or when you enter combat, enter a Dreamstate, reducing the cast time of your next 2 Starfires or Wraths by 40% and increasing their damage by 100%.

Looks to be a ~5.1% increase from having no tier
If the buff is up when entering combat your first wrath/starfire will be affected by the buff and your 2p stacks will then reset back to 2 when you finish your cast


- Use {{< spell 202425 "Warrior of Elune" >}} if your eclipse is about to end and you will enter Solar Eclipse next.
- Use {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}} to enter Solar Eclipse.
