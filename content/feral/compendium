# [1. News:](#news)

## 10.2 News
### Tier Set
> 2p:  Feral Frenzy grants Smoldering Frenzy, increasing all damage you deal by 20% for 8 seconds.

> 4p: Feral Frenzyâ€™s cooldown is reduced by 15 seconds. During Smoldering Frenzy, enemies burn for 10% of damage you deal as Fire over 10 seconds.

### List of changes

**Apex Predator's Craving**
Rip ticks have a 7.2% (was 4%) chance in single target to make next bite free. This chance now gets reduced as ripped targets increases. This comes out to be a gain below 4 targets, and a loss at 4+ targets.

**Ashamane's Guidance (Incarnation) is reworked**
During incarnation and for 30 seconds afterwards, Rip and Rake cause affected enemies to take 3% increased damage from your abilities. This stacks, coming out to a little over 6% damage taken debuff. This is just strictly worse than Carnivorous Instinct and will never be played at its current tuning.

**Cat's Curiosity is Removed**
**Saber Jaws has been added to replace Cat's Curiosity:**
Rank 1: When you spend extra Energy on Ferocious Bite, the extra damage is increased by 40%.
Rank 2: When you spend extra Energy on Ferocious Bite, the extra damage is increased by 80%.

Since this only buffs the extra damage portion of bite, at max energy the total damage of Ferocious Bite is increased by 20/40%. This does NOT work on free bites from Convoke or Apex.

**Relentless Predator**
Instead of reducing the cost of Ferocious Bite by 20%, this now reduces its cost by 10%. This effectively kills the talent in all situations. I am expecting this node to be replaced in a future patch.

**Rampant Ferocity**
This got buffed by 10%. Nothing changes about when you select this talent, as the aformentioned Apex nerf at larger target counts hurt the effectiveness of Rampant Ferocity.

**Innervate** is now castable in Cat Form. Rejoice.

# [2.Rotation:](#rotation)

**What is a priority list?**

When reading the priority lists below, you should not think about these as steps to follow in a specific order. At any given point in combat, you should cast the first thing in the list that you are able to cast. As such, you will note that there are some abilities included in the priority lists below that are not chosen as talents in the recommended build. This is not a mistake, but simply indicates the priority of that ability IF you happened to take it for whatever reason. The presence of an ability in a priority list does not mean that you should be talenting into or using that ability, these lines are simply there for completeness. If the length of these lists feels daunting, one might recommend copying them to a separate document and removing lines that do not apply to you, thus making the list a bit more compact.

<div id="precombat">

## [Pre-combat](#precombat)

</div>

**Pre-Combat:**
- Use {{< spell 319454 "Heart of the Wild" >}}
- Use {{< spell 102547 "Prowl" >}}
- Use {{< spell 5217 "Tiger's Fury" >}}
- Use {{< spell 1822 "Rake" >}} from stealth.

<div id="st">

## [Single Target priority](#st)

</div>

**Single Target priority list:**
- Use {{< spell 5217 "Tiger's Fury" >}} if any of the following conditions are met:
    - You've talented {{< spell 391528  "Convoke the Spirits" >}} and do not have 10.2 tier set equipped. (Using it on CD keeps {{< spell 5217 "TF" >}} and {{< spell 391528  "Convoke" >}} aligned.)
    - {{< spell 5217 "Tiger's Fury" >}} is not up.
    - You are more than 65 energy from the cap.
    - You have 10.2 2 piece set bonus equipped, and {{> spell 274838 "Feral Frenzy" >}} is ready to be used.
- Without {{< spell 391951 "Unbridled Swarm" >}} talented, use {{< spell 391889 "Adaptive Swarm" >}} when all of these conditions are met:
    - There isn't a swarm heading to an enemy target.
    - Adaptive swarm is either not up or it is about to expire with 1 or 2 stacks.
- With {{< spell 391951 "Unbridled Swarm" >}} talented, the conditions change based on the amount of Swarms you have out:
    - If you have 3 swarms with at least 2 stacks out then you will target allies with priority 1 stack > 0 stack > 2 stacks.
    - If you have 2 or fewer swarms of at least 2 stacks, cast on your enemy target when swarm is not on them, and is not traveling towards them.
- Use {{< spell 102543 "Incarnation" >}} if it's ready.
- Use {{< spell 106951 "Berserk" >}} if it's ready. If you're playing 2 minute {{< spell 391528  "Convoke" >}}, you can instead hold {{< spell 106951 "Berserk" >}} for {{< spell 391528  "Convoke" >}} where fight timers are good to do so, especially if you have Ashes of the Embersoul, Witherbark's Branch, or will be buffed by an Augmentation Evoker every 2 minutes.
    - If it's your last berserk of the fight, line it up with {{< spell 391528  "Convoke" >}} where possible.
- Use {{< spell 391528  "Convoke" >}} if all of the following conditions are met:
    - {{< spell 1079 "Rip" >}} will not fall off during {{< spell 391528  "Convoke" >}}'s channel.
    - {{< spell 5217 "Tiger's Fury" >}} is up.
    - {{< spell 422751 "Smoldering Frenzy" >}} is up or you do not have 10.2 4 piece set bonus equipped.
    - You have 0 or 1 combo points OR {{< spell 422751 "Smoldering Frenzy" >}} would fall off before {{< spell 391528  "Convoke" >}} ends.
- Use {{< spell 274838 "Feral Frenzy" >}} if all of the following conditions are met:
    - {{< spell 417710 "Dire Fixation" >}} (if talented) is applied to the target.
    - You have less than 2 combo points and are not in {{< spell 102543 "Incarn" >}}/{{< spell 106951 "Berserk" >}}, or under 3 combo points during {{< spell 102543 "Incarn" >}}/{{< spell 106951 "Berserk" >}}.
- Use {{< spell 22568 "Ferocious Bite" >}} if you have a {{< spell 391881 "Apex Predator's Craving" >}} proc.
### If you are in Berserk see [here](#Berserk) as your priorities from this point on change a bit.
- If you have {{< spell 411344 "Predator Revealed" >}} active from 10.1 4 piece set bonus, 4 combo points and are at least 40 energy away from cap, wait until you passively gain your 5th combo point.
- Use {{< spell 1079 "Rip" >}} when all of these conditions are met:

        - Your next gcd will be Feral Frenzy
    - {{< spell 1079 "Rip" >}} has less than 2 seconds remaining, or you don't have {{< spell 422751 "Smoldering Frenzy" >}} up. Yes this means {{< spell 1079 "Rip" >}} will sometimes fall off with proper play.
    - {{< spell 5217 "Tiger's Fury" >}} is up, or won't be up before {{< spell 1079 "Rip" >}} expires.
    - {{< spell 319439 "Bloodtalons" >}} (if talented) is up, or won't be up before {{< spell 1079 "Rip" >}} expires.
- Use {{< spell 22568 "Ferocious Bite" >}} when all of these conditions are met:
    - You have at least 4 combo points
    - You have at least 50 energy OR you have Relentless Predator talented and at least 45 energy. If you have the combo points, you should wait until you reach these energy thresholds.

    - You do not have a {{< spell 384667 "Sudden Ambush" >}} proc

    - You are in stealth
    - You have a {{< spell 384667 "Sudden Ambush" >}} proc and you would be upgrading {{< spell 1822 "Rake" >}}'s snapshot value.

- Use {{< spell 106785 "Swipe" >}} if you still need {{< spell 319439 "Bloodtalons" >}}.

## Dungeon Talents
The following are dungeon talent builds that will always serve you well but mind that there can be some variations based on your group comp or affixes. Mind that while all these builds use Moons, FoE will result in about the same dps. FoE will often not align with Pulsar which can make it annoying to play with.

### Dungeon Druid Tree Considerations

- Ursine Vigor, Well-Honed Instincts and Improved Stampeding Roar are the major competing talents. Ursine Vigor should be taken if you need it to survive certain abilities. Well-Honed Instincts is always on 1 point but a 2nd can be taken if you rarely/never use Bear Form. Improved Stampeding Roar is extremely useful in indoor dungeons and in spiteful weeks.
- Remove Corruption should be taken in Afflicted weeks and can be taken in every dungeon except Vortex Pinnacle if your group is lacking decurse/poison dispel.
- Cyclone has basically no use other than stopping Bursting and can be replaced with anything else(which also won't have any use).
- Hibernate can be used for the Incorporeal affix.
- All other talents in the druid tree are more or less set.

**ST**

Damage wise, with 100% uptime on all of the Phials and not counting in the downsides their hierarchy is as follows on ST:

- [Iced Phial of Corrupting Rage](https://www.wowhead.com/item=191329/iced-phial-of-corrupting-rage): Default phial unless the fight has too high damage intake or you are at risk of dying.
- [Phial of Static Empowerment](https://www.wowhead.com/item=191338/phial-of-static-empowerment):
- [Phial of Charged Isolation](https://www.wowhead.com/item=191332/phial-of-charged-isolation):

- [Phial of Glacial Fury](https://www.wowhead.com/item=191335/phial-of-glacial-fury): This Phial should never be used.

**AoE**:

The priority is the same as it is on ST.

## [Embellishments](#embellishments)

For Embellishments we craft [Toxic Thorn Footwraps](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193452/toxic-thorn-footwraps), this will be combined with [Toxified Armor Patch](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193552/toxified-armor-patch) which increases the effect of the boots by 100%. The proc effect on Toxic Thorn Footwraps can also proc a heal when actively healing. There are some effects like [Frenzied Regeneration](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=22842/frenzied-regeneration) that proc the heal as well which slightly reduces its value. Another consideration is that the [Toxic Thorn Footwraps](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193452/toxic-thorn-footwraps) reduce your maximum HP by about 4.4k which will make you slightly squishier but nonetheless, they are the biggest dps upgrade by a fair margin.
<br>Do note that Toxified can only be added to a crafted leather piece.
