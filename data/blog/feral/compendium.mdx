<summary>Advanced Single Target Priority</summary>

**What is a priority list?**

When reading the priority lists below, you should not think about these as steps to follow in a specific order. At any given point in combat, you should cast the first thing in the list that you are able to cast.

The way this section is written is very formulaic and has the same structure as the Action Priority List (APL) used in sims.

**Pre-Combat:**
- Use !Heart of the Wild!
- Use !Prowl!
- Use !Rake! from stealth.

**Select which talents you have talented to filter the priority list:**

    - If you have 3 !391888|Adaptive Swarms! with at least 2 stacks out then you will target allies with priority 1 stack > 0 stack > 2 stacks.
    - If you have 2 or fewer !391888|Adaptive Swarms! of at least 2 stacks, cast on your enemy target when swarm is not on them, and is not traveling towards them.

## Raid Talents

### T31 4pc Talent Builds (Amirdrassil tier-set, still applies in season 4)

[T31 Standard Convoke Single-Target](https://www.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/feral/DARAUEEBCQpCFREExhUQBROVFAVRUVFVKVRAQCBU)

[Raid Cleave](https://www.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/feral/DARAUEEBCYpCFREExRQQBBOVRURRQVFVIUVRQCFQ)

[Alternative L/R LI Single Target](https://www.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/feral/DARAUEEBCYpCFREExRQQBROVBAZRVVFUiURBQBE)

[Alternative L/R BrS Single Target](https://www.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/feral/DARAUEEBCQpCFREExhUQBROVFAVRUVFViURBQCBQ) (slightly worse).
- Note: generally best to play 'Standard Convoke' for single-target, assuming you have an on-use trinket like Ashes or Witherbark's. They sim equally, however Convoke offers more burst, and pulls ahead with Augmentation buffing you. Kill timers can also play a factor; if you are unsure, stick to Convoke. If you do play L/R, Infected Wounds can optionally be swapped for Lunar Inspiration with T31 as well.

### T31 Raid Talent Customisation

In the first two gates, you can freely swap between !Merciless Claws!, !Tireless Energy!, !Infected Wounds!, and !Primal Wrath!, based on what you need.
- !Merciless Claws! is the strongest burst option of these nodes, and only slightly behind in sustained single-target and cleave.
- !Infected Wounds! for stronger sustained single-target, or if multi-dotting with Rake.
- !Tireless Energy! for strong single-target and solid in cleave and AoE, but weaker for burst. You should also adjust points if you are overcapping energy via !391881|Apex! procs or downtime due to mechanics. 
- !Primal Wrath! if there are regular adds that need to die, or adds that can provide funnel opportunities with !391881|Apex!.
- Note: Tear Open Wounds and !Double-Clawed Rake! are additional options particularly for sustained AoE/cleave (Council), or if your raid is struggling with certain adds. 

Final gate options: swap between !Carnivorous Instinct!, !Circle of Life and Death!, !Saber Jaws!, !Rip and Tear!, 1 minute !Convoke the Spirits!, and !Adaptive Swarm!, as needed.
- !400320|Circle!: generally worth grabbing if taking !Primal Wrath! with !391881|Apex!, or if there's a lot of multi-dot potential.
- !Carnivorous Instinct!: strong burst, with good single-target and AoE. Predator resets and high !Tiger's Fury! uptime add value here.
- !Saber Jaws!: strong single-target pathing option to !391881|Apex!. 
- !Rip and Tear!: cleave and AoE pathing option to !391881|Apex!, not too far behind on single-target vs Saber Jaws with Convoke as it lets you spend another point elsewhere.
- 1m !Convoke the Spirits!: if you need more frequent burst, or are just a gambling addict. Your Kill times will also play a significant factor. For instance, if your raids kill time aligns better with the cooldown of 1 minute Convoke (odd e.g. 5:31) compared to 2 minute Convoke (even e.g. 4:31).
- !Adaptive Swarm!: incredibly strong single-target synergy with tier-set, can drop at times for heavy AoE.

### Class Tree Talents for Raid

- *Coming soon with specific boss builds. 
- For now: remember to take !Innervate!! You can cast in Cat Form now, and your healers will need it as the Rashok healer trinket has been nerfed.

## Dungeon Talents

The builds listed here are only a sample, and can be customised significantly. Various options and the logic on when you might swap certain talents are outlined in the section below.

[Funnel Option](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/talent-calc/druid/feral/DARAUEEBCQJCFVUExhUQBBOVRERVQVFVYRVBQCFU)

### [M+ Talent Customisation](#m+)

![Mythic](/static/images/feral-tree-mythic+.png)

Note: for Feral, the talents in the first two gates have similar power-levels, and you can freely distribute extra points how you please here, up until you have spent 20 points. The final gate has stronger nodes and you should always spend the maximum points possible here (10).

Options for the first two gates:
- !Double-Clawed Rake! -> !Rampant Ferocity!: this comes down to pull size; DCR particularly excels in low and medium (pug) size pulls and is generally the better choice, however RF can pull ahead with large pulls e.g. in a dungeon with dense trash or with an organised group doing consistent triple~ pulls.
- !Double-Clawed Rake! -> !Taste for Blood!: if you want more single target, TFB is a great option e.g. for Tyrannical weeks, while also providing some funnel value on trash.
- Tear Open Wounds -> !Rampant Ferocity!: if your goal is purely to funnel, you can change to RF and spend your finishers on Bite while only using !Primal Wrath! to maintain !Rip! in AoE. This is somewhat more advanced with more consideration for energy and combo points, and requires you to break 'primal wrath spam' muscle memory.
- !Infected Wounds! -> !Taste for Blood!: if you are not running Double-clawed Rake, Taste for Blood is a great option that offers a prominent single target gain over Infected Wounds this patch as a result of the !391881|Apex! changes. Even moreso if running !Convoke the Spirits!.
- !Taste for Blood! -> Dire Fixation: both are great single-target options, you can run Taste for Blood for more funnel (via Apex) and burst with Convoke.
- Dire Fixation -> !Rampant Ferocity!: you can run both Tear Open Wounds and Rampant Ferocity together if it is an AOE heavy dungeon, but single-target will be lower without Dire Fixation or Taste for Blood.

Options for the final gate:
- !Bloodtalons! vs !Lion's Strength!: in 10.2, BT gains a lot of quality of life when changing to the new tier-set, in addition to the !391881|Apex! change with procs slowing down slightly in AoE. This combined with the 10.1 change of 3 charges makes BT feel smooth to play in season 3 M+. However, Lion's Strength is still a competitive option and only a small DPS loss while allowing you to focus on other things. If you are fairly new to Feral, you should start with Lion's Strength and swap to Bloodtalons when you have learnt everything else.
- !Convoke the Spirits! vs !102543|Incarnation!: both talents are equally viable and will depend on your talents, gear, dungeon, and own preference. Convoke is very strong with Witherbark's Branch or similar on-use trinkets, and similarly should be played if dropping Rake talents such as Infected Wounds (as Incarn wants Rake talents), while Incarn can pull ahead with larger pulls. These two options are interchangeable though and there is no all-round 'best.' 
- 1 min !391528|Convoke!: generally worse than 2m, however is a competitive option if running !Rampant Ferocity!. Drop Carnivorous Instincts/Swarm for it.
- !Carnivorous Instinct! vs !Adaptive Swarm!: CI is your 'safe' all-round good pick, however Swarm is a very strong single-target option and should be considered for Tyrannical.
- !Unbridled Swarm!: for a talent that undersims, this is simming competitively with the more standard builds. In other words: this is looking to be very, very good this patch. Take in medium pull size dungeons.
- Honourable mention: !Veinripper! can be a good funnel option if playing a !Rampant Ferocity!-focused build and focusing on ethical prio-damage.

### M+ Class Tree

![MythicClass](/static/images/feral-class-tree-mythic+.png)

The druid tree offers a fair degree of customisation as Feral in M+, with a range of utility and defensive options. What is selected (yellow) is mandatory, with blue nodes being your options based on affixes or personal preference. 

- !Remove Corruption! for Afflicted weeks. Additionally, the following dungeons have poison and curse dispels: Atal'Dazar, Darkheart Thicket, Throne of the Tides, and Waycrest Manor.
- !Hibernate! for Incorporeal weeks.
- !Nature's Vigil! is still very strong in AoE, and will often keep you alive or minimise the need to Regrowth on big pulls, increasing your DPS. Over the dungeon it usually does more personal healing to you than any other talent, while also healing your group mates. Macro to Berserk/Incarn. 
- !Protector of the Pack! is a strong self-healing node for Feral, and gains even more value if you can occasionally utilise it to heal your group as well.
- !Nurturing Instinct! should only be considered if Beekeeping for small DPS and HPS gains.
- !Feline Swiftness! is commonly dropped in high-end for more defensives and utility, as Catform gives 30% speed baseline which is more than enough for dungeon mechanics. If uncomfortable, try only dropping 1 point at first to retain 8%.
- !Ursine Vigor! is more of a high-key talent to survive one-shots.

# Gearing:
 
## Stat Priority:

Sim yourself using [Raidbots Top Gear](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear). Do not follow any stat priorities.

## Gems and Enchants

Gems - 1x [Elusive Blasphemite](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213746/elusive-blasphemite) or [Culminating Blasphemite](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213743/culminating-blasphemite) and a mixture of the other gems based on your sims. You'll need to sim one gem slot at a time. I would generally recommend [Elusive Blasphemite](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213746/elusive-blasphemite), as the crit effect portion of [Culminating Blasphemite](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213743/culminating-blasphemite) is incredibly weak.

Weapon - [Authority of the Depths](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223784/enchant-weapon-authority-of-the-depths) for raid, [Stonebound Artistry](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223765/enchant-weapon-stonebound-artistry) or [Stormrider's Fury](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223762/enchant-weapon-stormriders-fury) for M+

Chest - [Crystalline Radiance](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223692/enchant-chest-crystalline-radiance)

Cloak - [Chant of Winged Grace](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223731/enchant-cloak-chant-of-winged-grace)

Legs - [Stormbound Armor Kit](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219911/stormbound-armor-kit)

Wrist - [Chant of Armored Avoidance](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223713/enchant-bracer-chant-of-armored-avoidance)

Boots - [Defender's March](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223656/enchant-boots-defenders-march) or [Scout's March](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223653/enchant-boots-scouts-march)

Ring -  You should always sim your own character to determine what enchant to use in this slot. They tend to be very close.

## Embellishments

**Crafting order**

## Trinkets

Please use Top Gear or Droptimizer on [Raidbots](https://raidbots.com) in order to decide what trinkets to use/farm, but the following list should give you a good idea of some of the trinkets you will want to look out for. The list is in roughly power-level order assuming the highest item level versions of the trinkets. 
### To use in Raid

- [Trinket 1]()

### To use in Dungeons

- [Trinket 1]()

# Miscellaneous:

## What is snapshotting?

Snapshotting is when a buff that is present when a bleed is applied is maintained over the duration of the bleed, as opposed to buffing dots while the buff is up. For instance, if you !Rake! a target, and then press !Tiger's Fury!, the !Rake! will not be buffed by !Tiger's Fury!. However, if you !Tiger's Fury! and then !Rake!, that !Rake! will be amplified by !Tiger's Fury! even after !Tiger's Fury! falls off.

Rake snapshots !Tiger's Fury! and Stealth (including !Sudden Ambush!, see: !Pouncing Strikes!)
Rip snapshots !Tiger's Fury! and !Bloodtalons!
Thrash snapshots !Tiger's Fury! and !Moment of Clarity!
Moonfire (Lunar Inspiration) snapshots !Tiger's Fury!

If you have a Weakaura that tracks snapshot strength, it works as follows:
Green/higher than 100: Reapplying the bleed now would make it stronger
Grey/100: Reapplying the bleed now would keep it the same strength
Red/lower than 100: Reapplying the bleed now would make it weaker

Generally you try to maintain the strongest bleeds you can as much as possible, and the rotation above reflects this.

## What does pandemic refer to?

Pandemic is a mechanic that most damage-over-time spells have. When you cast a damage-over-time spell such as Rake while it's already applied to the target, the dots duration gets extended by the amount of time remaining on the dot. This extension is capped to 30% of the dots duration. For example, lets say you have a dot that has a 10 second duration. If you recast this dot while it has 2 seconds left, its new duration is 12 seconds. If you recast it again while it has 8 seconds left, its new duration is 13 seconds, because 30% of 10 seconds is 3 seconds. Pandemic got its name from an old warlock passive with the same effect, before it became a baseline feature of damage-over-time spells.

## Macros

None of these macros are required by any means, just a few that can be useful for some people.

**Ursol's Vortex @cursor macro:**

```
#showtooltip
/cast [@cursor] Ursol's Vortex
```

**Trinket macro:**

If you are using an on-use trinket/weapon that should go along with your cooldowns, use the following macro: (/13 for top trinket slot, /14 for bottom trinket slot and /16 for weapon.)
```
#showtooltip
/use 13
/use 14
/use 16
/cast Berserk
```

**Entangling Roots macro:**

Casts Entangling Roots on a target you mouseover, otherwise casts on current target if no mouseover.
```
#showtooltip
/cast [@mouseover, harm, nodead] [] Entangling Roots
```

**Focus Skull Bash:**

Casts Skull Bash at your focus target, or current target if there is no eligible enemy focus target. Remember to bind focus target in WoW keybind settings.
```
#showtooltip
/cast [@focus, harm, nodead] [] skull bash
```

**Adaptive Swarm macro:**

Casts Swarm on your current target, or a friendly if you mouseover them. This can be applied to numerous abilities you cast on allies (Dispel, Rejuv/Regrowth, Innervate etc to save on keybinds), as seen in the Rebirth macro further below. 
```
#showtooltip
/cast [@mouseover, help, nodead] [] Adaptive Swarm
