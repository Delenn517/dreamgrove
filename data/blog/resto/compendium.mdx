summary: 'A list of the main resources for Restoration Druid'

This page should serve as a hub and an explainer for the most useful guides and resources available for Resto Druid Raid and M+ gameplay.

# Major Guides

Our official guides are complementary, so you should read them all. We don't recommend video guides as they go out-of-date quickly.

- **[Wowhead](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/classes/druid/restoration/overview-pve-healer)**: Resto pages on Wowhead are written and kept up-to-date by Voulk. They will always include an overview of meta/starter talent builds, gear, rotations, and general gameplay tips. 

- **[Icy Veins](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/restoration-druid-pve-healing-guide)**: Resto pages on Icy Veins are written and kept up-to-date by Torty. His write-ups build on class foundational knowledge and offer more in-depth explanations on how to optimise our kit for different content and scenarios.
  - [Current Raid tier (Amirdrassil) healing encounter guide](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/restoration-druid-pve-healing-amirdrassil-raid-guide)
  - [Doing damage in PvE content](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/restoration-druid-pve-dps-guide) (Updated for TWW Pre-Patch)

- **[Questionably Epic](https://questionablyepic.com/restodruid-sheet/)**: Resto pages on Questionably Epic are written by Voulk. Our other guides above will basically always be kept more up-to-date than QE as its "simulation" side is the higher priority.

# "Simming" Resto Druid

It's not actually simming, but it's the closest we've got.

## Questionably Epic Live

**[Questionably Epic Live](https://questionablyepic.com/live/)** (QELive): QELive was created by Voulk and is our resource that is kept most up-to-date. Select the Dungeon or Raid setting at the top of the page, and use the Top Gear module to find your best set of gear based on everything you own and put into it. Top Gear includes all aspects of gear including set bonuses, stat diminishing returns, special effects, Great Vault exclusivity, and more.
  - [Voulk's Wowhead tutorial](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/how-to-use-qe-live-tool-guide) on how to use all of QELive's tools
  - Super handy page: [Trinkets graph](https://questionablyepic.com/live/trinkets)

## Raidbots

**[Raidbots](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot)**: Raidbots is the default resource for actually simulating Resto Druid damage, like for application in M+. I'm unsure who maintains our Raidbots APL or how up-to-date it actually is.

# Other Resources

## WoWAnalyzer

Resto Druids can use [WoWAnalyzer](https://wowanalyzer.com/) to receive general feedback on logs (works best with Raid logs). Our modules are maintained by Sref.
